# Activity Summary for 10/21/2025

## 8:58:09 PM
The provided log details recent changes across a Go-based `transaction-history` service, focusing on data mapping, dependency management, and environment-specific configurations.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-history/service/api/transactions/mapper/mapper_response.go` (Timestamp: 10/21/2025, 4:47:57 PM):** This Go file received substantial updates to its transaction mapping logic. It defines numerous functions (e.g., `ConvertSearchResponse`, `ConvertTransaction`, `getDates`, `convertIdentifiers`, `convertCategories`) responsible for transforming `transactionservicepb` messages into `transactionspb` structures. Key aspects include handling `nil` values, formatting timestamps to ISO8601, conditional logic for appending dates based on `providerMarkets`, and logging warnings for invalid timestamps or conflicting external IDs. The use of `log/slog` for structured logging is also notable.
*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-history/go.mod` (Timestamp: 10/21/2025, 5:00:18 PM):** This file shows a comprehensive update of direct and indirect Go module dependencies. Many core libraries, including `github.com/golang/protobuf`, `google.golang.org/grpc`, `google.golang.org/protobuf`, and several `golang.org/x` packages, were updated to newer versions. Integration libraries for Datadog, Unleash, and AWS SDK also received updates. Additionally, several `github.com/tink-ab` internal modules are set to be replaced by local paths, indicating ongoing development within the same workspace.
*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-history/go.sum` (Timestamp: 10/21/2025, 5:00:40 PM):** This file reflects the updated checksums for the wide array of module dependencies specified in `go.mod`. Its extensive length underscores the significant number of dependencies in the project.
*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-history/.charts/transaction-history/values.yaml` (Timestamps: 10/21/2025, 5:01:50 PM, 5:02:51 PM, 5:05:48 PM):** This Helm chart configuration defines deployment settings for the service. It covers authentication, various client service configurations, tracing, transaction and reports API limits, storage (with Vault integration), Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) settings, and extensive Datadog monitoring configurations for Kubernetes (CPU, memory, deployment health, pod issues). The primary change across these timestamps is a minor case adjustment in the `provider_markets` list, changing `se-oxford-abstract` to `SE-OXFORD-ABSTRACT` at 5:02:51 PM.
*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-history/service/development/configuration.yaml` (Timestamp: 10/21/2025, 5:03:27 PM):** This file specifies configuration tailored for the development environment. It includes gRPC addresses with reflection and local TLS, `transactions_api` settings (with `enable_get_single_transaction` set to `true`), a smaller `reports_api` `msg_size_limit` and `snapshot_days_limit` compared to production, and explicit disabling of authentication and storage.
*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-history/system_test/configuration/transaction_history.yaml` (Timestamp: 10/21/2025, 5:06:04 PM):** This configuration is dedicated to system tests. It enables `transaction_service_client` pointing to a `TransactionServiceTestContainer` with insecure gRPC, defines gRPC addresses for testing, sets `transactions_api` parameters (including `enable_get_single_transaction: true`), and configures `reports_api` with a significantly higher `snapshot_days_limit` (10000). Storage is enabled with specific S3 test configurations, including a local endpoint, and authentication and other service clients are disabled.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/21/2025, 4:47:57 PM:** Core application logic for transaction data transformation was updated.
*   **10/21/2025, 5:00:18 PM:** A major dependency update occurred, impacting many foundational Go and gRPC libraries.
*   **10/21/2025, 5:01:50 PM - 5:06:04 PM:** A concentrated period of configuration adjustments across production (`values.yaml`), development (`development/configuration.yaml`), and system test (`system_test/configuration/transaction_history.yaml`) environments, including a minor but consistent casing change in `provider_markets`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent `provider_markets`:** The list `UK`, `GB`, `SE-OXFORD-ABSTRACT` appears across `values.yaml`, `development/configuration.yaml`, and `system_test/configuration/transaction_history.yaml`, with a specific casing standardization identified in `values.yaml`.
*   **Environment-Specific Overrides:** Configurations like `enable_get_single_transaction` (true in dev/test, false in prod), `auth: enabled` (false in dev/test, true in prod), `reports_api` limits, and `storage` settings are tailored for each environment, demonstrating a clear separation of concerns for development, testing, and production.
*   **G-RPC Focus:** The service heavily relies on gRPC, with internal and external endpoints, reflection, and client configurations for various microservices.
*   **Observability Integration:** Datadog is a central component for APM and comprehensive Kubernetes monitoring, indicated by extensive alert definitions in `values.yaml`.
*   **Dependency Management:** The `go.mod` file shows a commitment to keeping dependencies up-to-date and managing internal module replacements for a streamlined development process.
