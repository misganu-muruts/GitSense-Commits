# Activity Summary for 10/27/2025

## 9:10:55 AM
All observed changes occurred on October 24, 2025, suggesting a focused session of development or refactoring within the `tink/transaction-service` project. The updates primarily affect the internal gRPC transaction service and its Cassandra data mapping.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go`**

*   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 8:39:54 AM**: This file defines the `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl`, which handles `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` gRPC calls. It integrates with Cassandra for data retrieval, includes logic for date range calculations, filtering, sorting, and pagination for transaction listings. It uses `cassandra.ToV2Internal` for converting Cassandra transactions to the internal v2 protobuf format.
*   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 8:40:00 AM**: No functional changes were observed compared to the previous timestamp.
*   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 8:52:30 AM**: A significant refactoring change occurred. The function used to convert Cassandra transactions to the v2 internal format was renamed from `cassandra.ToV2Internal` to `cassandra.FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal` within both the `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` methods. This explicitly clarifies that the conversion is from a Cassandra V1 structure to a V2 internal representation.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/cassandra/mapper.go`**

*   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 8:52:44 AM**: This file contains extensive logic for mapping `proto.Transaction` structures to `CassandraTransaction` (and vice-versa) using numerous helper functions for type conversions, serialization, and deserialization of various transaction fields (e.g., amounts, dates, IDs, payloads, and merchant details).
*   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 8:53:08 AM**: A new `Logger` interface was introduced at the package level:
    ```go
    type Logger interface {
        Warn(ctx context.Context, msg string, args ...interface{})
    }
    ```
    This change signifies an effort to abstract the logging mechanism, allowing for dependency injection of logger implementations, specifically for warning messages.
*   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 8:53:42 AM**: A comment `// Logger interface for V2 mapper` was added above the `Logger` interface definition for improved code documentation.
*   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 8:54:05 AM**: No functional changes were observed compared to the previous timestamp.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Refactoring and Clarity:** The changes indicate an ongoing refactoring effort to improve code clarity and maintainability. Renaming `ToV2Internal` to `FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal` explicitly states the source and target formats, while introducing a `Logger` interface modularizes logging concerns.
*   **Focus on Internal V2 API:** Both files show changes related to `internal_v2` protobuf definitions, highlighting development and refinement of the internal transaction service API.
*   **Cassandra Integration:** The core functionality revolves around Cassandra as the persistent data store for transactions, with significant effort invested in mapping between Cassandra's data model and the application's protobuf structures.
*   **Logging Abstraction:** The introduction of a `Logger` interface points towards a pattern of abstracting infrastructure concerns (like logging) for greater flexibility and testability.
