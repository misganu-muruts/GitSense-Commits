# Activity Summary for 10/28/2025

## 8:24:52 AM
The changes primarily involve two Go files related to a transaction service, focusing on Cassandra integration and internal gRPC service logic, all occurring on October 24, 2025, within a short timeframe.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go`**

*   **Updates (8:52:30 AM):** The primary change in this file is a consistent refactoring of the transaction conversion function. The function `cassandra.ToV2Internal` was renamed to `cassandra.FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal` in both the `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` gRPC handler methods. This indicates a more explicit naming convention for converting Cassandra V1 transactions to the V2 internal format.
*   **No functional changes were observed at 8:40:00 AM** compared to the 8:39:54 AM entry.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/cassandra/mapper.go`**

*   **Updates (8:53:08 AM):** A `Logger` interface was introduced, defining a `Warn` method. This suggests an effort to standardize or integrate logging more formally within the transaction mapping logic.
*   **Updates (8:53:42 AM):** A clarifying comment `// Logger interface for V2 mapper` was added to the newly introduced `Logger` interface, specifying its intended use case.
*   **No functional changes were observed at 8:54:05 AM** compared to the 8:53:42 AM entry.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **V2 API Focus:** There's a clear emphasis on "V2" internal transaction formats, with conversion functions explicitly named for this purpose (`FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal`). This suggests an ongoing migration or development toward a new version of the transaction API.
*   **Cassandra Integration:** Both files heavily deal with fetching and converting data from Cassandra, implying Cassandra is the primary data store for these transactions.
*   **Logging Improvements:** The introduction and documentation of a `Logger` interface in the `mapper.go` file indicate an initiative to improve error handling and observability within the transaction mapping process.
*   **Time-Sensitive Development:** All changes occurred on the same day within a span of roughly 15 minutes, suggesting a concentrated effort on a specific set of related tasks.
