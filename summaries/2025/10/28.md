# Activity Summary for 10/28/2025

## 8:24:52 AM
The changes primarily involve two Go files related to a transaction service, focusing on Cassandra integration and internal gRPC service logic, all occurring on October 24, 2025, within a short timeframe.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go`**

*   **Updates (8:52:30 AM):** The primary change in this file is a consistent refactoring of the transaction conversion function. The function `cassandra.ToV2Internal` was renamed to `cassandra.FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal` in both the `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` gRPC handler methods. This indicates a more explicit naming convention for converting Cassandra V1 transactions to the V2 internal format.
*   **No functional changes were observed at 8:40:00 AM** compared to the 8:39:54 AM entry.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/cassandra/mapper.go`**

*   **Updates (8:53:08 AM):** A `Logger` interface was introduced, defining a `Warn` method. This suggests an effort to standardize or integrate logging more formally within the transaction mapping logic.
*   **Updates (8:53:42 AM):** A clarifying comment `// Logger interface for V2 mapper` was added to the newly introduced `Logger` interface, specifying its intended use case.
*   **No functional changes were observed at 8:54:05 AM** compared to the 8:53:42 AM entry.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **V2 API Focus:** There's a clear emphasis on "V2" internal transaction formats, with conversion functions explicitly named for this purpose (`FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal`). This suggests an ongoing migration or development toward a new version of the transaction API.
*   **Cassandra Integration:** Both files heavily deal with fetching and converting data from Cassandra, implying Cassandra is the primary data store for these transactions.
*   **Logging Improvements:** The introduction and documentation of a `Logger` interface in the `mapper.go` file indicate an initiative to improve error handling and observability within the transaction mapping process.
*   **Time-Sensitive Development:** All changes occurred on the same day within a span of roughly 15 minutes, suggesting a concentrated effort on a specific set of related tasks.

## 9:25:02 AM
The changes primarily focus on a transaction service, specifically enhancing its internal gRPC API for listing transactions and refining data mapping to and from Cassandra.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go`**

*   **October 24, 2025, 8:39:54 AM - 8:40:00 AM:** The `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl` initially provided `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` methods. The `ListTransactions` method used a basic offset-based pagination strategy, calculating periods from date ranges, fetching all relevant transactions, applying filters, sorting, and then slicing for pagination, generating a simple offset-based `NextPageToken`.
*   **October 24, 2025, 8:52:30 AM:** A minor, but notable, refactoring occurred where the transaction conversion function used in `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` was renamed from `cassandra.ToV2Internal` to `cassandra.FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal`.
*   **October 28, 2025, 8:24:59 AM:** This timestamp marks a significant architectural update. The `ListTransactions` method was refactored to implement **cursor-based pagination** rather than offset-based. This involved:
    *   Adding imports for `encoding/base64` and `encoding/json`.
    *   Introducing a `PaginationCursor` struct to store `LastPeriod` and `LastTransactionID` for persistent pagination state across requests.
    *   Modifying the `ListTransactions` logic to `decodeCursor` from the request's `PageToken`.
    *   Replacing `fetchAllCassandraTransactions` and `fetchCassandraTransactionsByPeriods` with a new `fetchTransactionsWithCursor` (which implies a more complex fetching logic across Cassandra partitions based on the cursor).
    *   Updating the `NextPageToken` generation to `encodeCursor` based on the `Period` and `ID` of the last transaction in the current page, ensuring efficient scrolling through potentially large datasets across different Cassandra partitions.
    *   The changes were explicitly marked with `/* START GENAI */` and `/* END GENAI */` comments, suggesting an AI-assisted or standardized generation process for this refactoring.
*   **October 28, 2025, 9:15:22 AM:** A minor clarification was made to the comment for the `PaginationCursor` struct, explicitly stating it's for "cursor-based pagination." No functional change.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/cassandra/mapper.go`**

*   **October 24, 2025, 8:52:44 AM:** This file contains extensive logic for mapping transaction data between Protobuf (`proto.Transaction`) and Cassandra's internal `CassandraTransaction` structure. It defines `ToCassandra` and `FromCassandra` functions, along with numerous helper functions for handling UUIDs, timestamps, amounts, and nested structures like `TransactionPart`, `Counterparty`, and `MerchantGeolocation`/`Address`.
*   **October 24, 2025, 8:53:08 AM:** A `Logger` interface was introduced within the `cassandra` package (`type Logger interface { Warn(ctx context.Context, msg string, args ...interface{}) }`). This standardizes how logging, specifically warnings, should be performed within this part of the codebase.
*   **October 24, 2025, 8:53:42 AM - 8:54:05 AM:** A comment was added to the `Logger` interface to clarify its purpose: `// Logger interface for V2 mapper`. No functional changes were observed in these timestamps.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Cassandra Integration:** Both files are deeply integrated with Cassandra, handling transaction storage, retrieval, and schema mapping.
*   **gRPC and Protobuf:** The system relies heavily on gRPC for its API and Protobuf for data serialization, indicated by extensive imports and usage of `internal_transactionpb` and `proto` types.
*   **Transaction Processing:** A core theme is the management of financial transactions, including filtering, sorting, and pagination.
*   **Data Conversion:** A significant effort is placed on converting between different data representations (Protobuf, Cassandra-specific structs, `inf.Dec`, `gocql.UUID`).
*   **Date/Time Handling:** Dates are crucial, with `DateLayout = "2006-01-02"` and calculations for Cassandra `Period` (YYYYMM) being prominent.
*   **Pagination Evolution:** A notable pattern is the shift from simpler offset-based pagination to more robust cursor-based pagination, especially crucial for distributed databases like Cassandra to avoid performance issues with large offsets.
*   **Logging Standardisation:** The introduction of a dedicated `Logger` interface suggests a move towards more structured and consistent logging practices.
*   **Distributed Tracing:** The use of `gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/ddtrace/tracer` indicates that the service is instrumented for distributed tracing, allowing for monitoring and debugging of request flows.
