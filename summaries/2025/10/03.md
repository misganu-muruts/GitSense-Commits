# Activity Summary for 10/3/2025

## 7:42:37 AM
For the file `golang.go.Go`, the logs detail a sequence of events related to Go development environment setup.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The log for `golang.go.Go` primarily reports on the status of Go tool installations and the language server. It shows an attempt to install `staticcheck` (from `honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@latest`) which *failed* due to a "Proxy Authentication Required" error when trying to access `tink.jfrog.io/artifactory`. Following this failure, the language server `gopls` (version `v0.20.0/go1.25.1`) was successfully started.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
*   **2025-10-02 21:14:57:** Initialization of the Go tools environment and the start of the `staticcheck` installation attempt.
*   **2025-10-02 21:15:01:** The `staticcheck` installation failed due to proxy authentication issues.
*   **2025-10-02 21:15:02:** The Go language server (`gopls`) was successfully started.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
The most notable recurring element is the "Proxy Authentication Required" error message, which is explicitly mentioned multiple times when detailing the failure of `staticcheck` installation. This indicates a consistent network or proxy configuration issue affecting external tool downloads. The timestamps are very close together, showing a rapid sequence of events from tool installation attempt to failure, and then language server activation.

## 9:42:45 AM
The provided log details changes to the `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go` file, with a timestamp of 10/3/2025, 9:10:09 AM.

This file implements the `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl`, serving gRPC endpoints for an internal transaction service. Key updates and functionalities include:

*   **Service Definition**: The `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl` is a gRPC server for internal transaction operations, integrating with `searchClient` and `accountServiceClient` for data retrieval and enrichment.
*   **Transaction Retrieval**:
    *   The `GetTransaction` method fetches a single transaction by user and transaction ID, performing a search, converting the result from a V1 transaction format to an internal format, and enriching it with account currency information.
    *   The `ListTransactions` method allows fetching multiple transactions, supporting pagination, sorting, and various filtering options.
*   **Data Conversion and Filtering Logic**:
    *   Extensive helper functions are introduced or updated to convert internal v2 request formats to the underlying v1 search service's request format.
    *   `ConvertSearchRequest` transforms `ListTransactionsRequest` by handling user ID, pagination, account ID filters, transaction ID filters, and date range restrictions. It defaults to sorting by date in descending order and enforces a `maxPageSize` of 1000.
    *   Date parsing functions (`parseTimeRestriction`, `parseTimeWithDefault`, `createTimeRestriction`) are used to convert string dates (`2006-01-02` layout) into protobuf timestamps for search queries.
    *   A sophisticated `convertStatusInFilter` and `convertStatusInFilterFlag` mechanism translates internal transaction statuses (PENDING, BOOKED) into an `IsPending` boolean filter for the search service, allowing for filtering by pending, booked, both, or neither.
*   **Account Currency Enrichment**: The `getAccountCurrency` method fetches missing currency codes for transactions from an `accountServiceClient`, logging warnings if the retrieval fails.
*   **Observability**: Datadog tracing is integrated into `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` methods to monitor performance.
*   **Error Handling**: Standard gRPC status codes are used for error reporting, such as `FailedPrecondition` for invalid requests and `NotFound` if a transaction cannot be located.

The changes primarily focus on enhancing the internal transaction service's ability to search, retrieve, and filter transaction data, translating between different API versions, and enriching data, all while ensuring robust error handling and observability.

## 10:05:51 AM
The provided log details changes exclusively to a single Protobuf definition file: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/tink-grpc/tink/transaction_service/internal_v2/transactions_service.proto`.

**File-specific Updates:**

The file defines a `TransactionsService` with two RPC methods: `ListTransactions` and `GetTransaction`. It also specifies the messages used by these methods: `ListTransactionsRequest`, `ListTransactionsResponse`, `GetTransactionRequest`, and a comprehensive `Transaction` message.

The `Transaction` message is richly structured, containing nested messages for:
*   `TransactionInformation`: Detailed, unstructured descriptions.
*   `Descriptions`: Original and detailed transaction descriptions.
*   `Dates`: Booking, value, and transaction dates in ISO-8601 format.
*   `Timestamps`: Booking, value, and transaction date/times in ISO-8601 UTC format.
*   `Identifiers`: External transaction IDs.
*   `Types`: Includes a `Type` enum (e.g., CREDIT_CARD, PAYMENT) and a `financial_institution_type_code`.
*   A top-level `Status` enum for transaction booking status (UNDEFINED, PENDING, BOOKED).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/3/2025, 9:14:56 AM (Initial Entry):** This timestamp marks the appearance of the full Protobuf definition. At this point, the `Type` enum within the `Types` message had a comment `//(DEPRECATED) Tink transaction type.`, and the `type` field itself also carried the `(DEPRECATED)` tag in its comment.
*   **10/3/2025, 9:23:58 AM:** The comment for the `Types.Type` enum definition was subtly altered from `//(DEPRECATED) Tink transaction type.` to `// Tink transaction type`. The `(DEPRECATED)` tag was removed from the enum's introductory comment.
*   **10/3/2025, 9:35:13 AM:** A minor, stylistic change occurred in the comment for `Types.Type` enum, where a period was added, changing it to `// Tink transaction type.`.
*   **10/3/2025, 9:40:57 AM:** The most notable functional change. The `(DEPRECATED)` tag was explicitly removed from the comment of the `Type type = 1;` field within the `Types` message. This indicates a decision to no longer mark this specific field as deprecated in the schema comments.

Between these timestamps, there were several entries with identical code, suggesting minor saves or checks without substantive changes.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Schema Stability:** The core structure of the `TransactionsService` and its associated messages (`ListTransactionsRequest`, `ListTransactionsResponse`, `GetTransactionRequest`, `Transaction`) remained entirely stable across all logged changes.
*   **Comment Refinement:** All observed changes relate to comments within the Protobuf file, specifically concerning the `(DEPRECATED)` status of the `Type` enum and its corresponding field. This indicates an iterative process of clarifying or updating documentation and deprecation markers.
*   **Data Types and Formats:** Consistent use of `google.protobuf.StringValue` for potentially null or empty string fields, and clear specification of ISO-8601 format for date and time fields within comments, are recurring patterns in the message definitions.
