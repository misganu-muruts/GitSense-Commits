# Activity Summary for 10/3/2025

## 7:42:37 AM
For the file `golang.go.Go`, the logs detail a sequence of events related to Go development environment setup.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The log for `golang.go.Go` primarily reports on the status of Go tool installations and the language server. It shows an attempt to install `staticcheck` (from `honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@latest`) which *failed* due to a "Proxy Authentication Required" error when trying to access `tink.jfrog.io/artifactory`. Following this failure, the language server `gopls` (version `v0.20.0/go1.25.1`) was successfully started.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
*   **2025-10-02 21:14:57:** Initialization of the Go tools environment and the start of the `staticcheck` installation attempt.
*   **2025-10-02 21:15:01:** The `staticcheck` installation failed due to proxy authentication issues.
*   **2025-10-02 21:15:02:** The Go language server (`gopls`) was successfully started.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
The most notable recurring element is the "Proxy Authentication Required" error message, which is explicitly mentioned multiple times when detailing the failure of `staticcheck` installation. This indicates a consistent network or proxy configuration issue affecting external tool downloads. The timestamps are very close together, showing a rapid sequence of events from tool installation attempt to failure, and then language server activation.

## 9:42:45 AM
The provided log details changes to the `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go` file, with a timestamp of 10/3/2025, 9:10:09 AM.

This file implements the `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl`, serving gRPC endpoints for an internal transaction service. Key updates and functionalities include:

*   **Service Definition**: The `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl` is a gRPC server for internal transaction operations, integrating with `searchClient` and `accountServiceClient` for data retrieval and enrichment.
*   **Transaction Retrieval**:
    *   The `GetTransaction` method fetches a single transaction by user and transaction ID, performing a search, converting the result from a V1 transaction format to an internal format, and enriching it with account currency information.
    *   The `ListTransactions` method allows fetching multiple transactions, supporting pagination, sorting, and various filtering options.
*   **Data Conversion and Filtering Logic**:
    *   Extensive helper functions are introduced or updated to convert internal v2 request formats to the underlying v1 search service's request format.
    *   `ConvertSearchRequest` transforms `ListTransactionsRequest` by handling user ID, pagination, account ID filters, transaction ID filters, and date range restrictions. It defaults to sorting by date in descending order and enforces a `maxPageSize` of 1000.
    *   Date parsing functions (`parseTimeRestriction`, `parseTimeWithDefault`, `createTimeRestriction`) are used to convert string dates (`2006-01-02` layout) into protobuf timestamps for search queries.
    *   A sophisticated `convertStatusInFilter` and `convertStatusInFilterFlag` mechanism translates internal transaction statuses (PENDING, BOOKED) into an `IsPending` boolean filter for the search service, allowing for filtering by pending, booked, both, or neither.
*   **Account Currency Enrichment**: The `getAccountCurrency` method fetches missing currency codes for transactions from an `accountServiceClient`, logging warnings if the retrieval fails.
*   **Observability**: Datadog tracing is integrated into `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` methods to monitor performance.
*   **Error Handling**: Standard gRPC status codes are used for error reporting, such as `FailedPrecondition` for invalid requests and `NotFound` if a transaction cannot be located.

The changes primarily focus on enhancing the internal transaction service's ability to search, retrieve, and filter transaction data, translating between different API versions, and enriching data, all while ensuring robust error handling and observability.

## 10:05:51 AM
The provided log details changes exclusively to a single Protobuf definition file: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/tink-grpc/tink/transaction_service/internal_v2/transactions_service.proto`.

**File-specific Updates:**

The file defines a `TransactionsService` with two RPC methods: `ListTransactions` and `GetTransaction`. It also specifies the messages used by these methods: `ListTransactionsRequest`, `ListTransactionsResponse`, `GetTransactionRequest`, and a comprehensive `Transaction` message.

The `Transaction` message is richly structured, containing nested messages for:
*   `TransactionInformation`: Detailed, unstructured descriptions.
*   `Descriptions`: Original and detailed transaction descriptions.
*   `Dates`: Booking, value, and transaction dates in ISO-8601 format.
*   `Timestamps`: Booking, value, and transaction date/times in ISO-8601 UTC format.
*   `Identifiers`: External transaction IDs.
*   `Types`: Includes a `Type` enum (e.g., CREDIT_CARD, PAYMENT) and a `financial_institution_type_code`.
*   A top-level `Status` enum for transaction booking status (UNDEFINED, PENDING, BOOKED).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/3/2025, 9:14:56 AM (Initial Entry):** This timestamp marks the appearance of the full Protobuf definition. At this point, the `Type` enum within the `Types` message had a comment `//(DEPRECATED) Tink transaction type.`, and the `type` field itself also carried the `(DEPRECATED)` tag in its comment.
*   **10/3/2025, 9:23:58 AM:** The comment for the `Types.Type` enum definition was subtly altered from `//(DEPRECATED) Tink transaction type.` to `// Tink transaction type`. The `(DEPRECATED)` tag was removed from the enum's introductory comment.
*   **10/3/2025, 9:35:13 AM:** A minor, stylistic change occurred in the comment for `Types.Type` enum, where a period was added, changing it to `// Tink transaction type.`.
*   **10/3/2025, 9:40:57 AM:** The most notable functional change. The `(DEPRECATED)` tag was explicitly removed from the comment of the `Type type = 1;` field within the `Types` message. This indicates a decision to no longer mark this specific field as deprecated in the schema comments.

Between these timestamps, there were several entries with identical code, suggesting minor saves or checks without substantive changes.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Schema Stability:** The core structure of the `TransactionsService` and its associated messages (`ListTransactionsRequest`, `ListTransactionsResponse`, `GetTransactionRequest`, `Transaction`) remained entirely stable across all logged changes.
*   **Comment Refinement:** All observed changes relate to comments within the Protobuf file, specifically concerning the `(DEPRECATED)` status of the `Type` enum and its corresponding field. This indicates an iterative process of clarifying or updating documentation and deprecation markers.
*   **Data Types and Formats:** Consistent use of `google.protobuf.StringValue` for potentially null or empty string fields, and clear specification of ISO-8601 format for date and time fields within comments, are recurring patterns in the message definitions.

## 11:42:51 AM
The provided log details changes to a single file, `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/go.mod`, recorded at `10/3/2025, 11:42:09 AM`.

**File-specific updates for `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/go.mod`:**

This file defines the module `github.com/tink-ab/transaction-service` with Go version `1.23.0` and toolchain `go1.23.4`. It lists a comprehensive set of direct and indirect dependencies, outlining the technologies and libraries used in the transaction service. Key direct dependencies include:

*   **Observability & Monitoring:** Integrations with DataDog (`github.com/DataDog/datadog-go/v5`, `gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1`) and structured logging with `go.uber.org/zap`.
*   **Messaging:** Kafka client `github.com/Shopify/sarama`.
*   **Feature Management:** `github.com/Unleash/unleash-client-go/v3` for feature toggles.
*   **Cloud & Storage:** AWS SDK (`github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go`) and various database clients for Redis (`github.com/go-redis/redis`), MySQL (`github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`), Cassandra/ScyllaDB (`github.com/gocql/gocql`, `github.com/scylladb/gocqlx`), and Elasticsearch/OpenSearch (`github.com/olivere/elastic`, `github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-go`).
*   **RPC/gRPC:** Extensive use of gRPC-related libraries including `google.golang.org/grpc`, `google.golang.org/protobuf`, `github.com/golang/protobuf`, and `github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware`.
*   **Internal Tink Libraries:** Dependencies on `github.com/tink-ab/tink-accounts-api` and `github.com/tink-ab/tink-grpc`, indicating integration within the broader Tink ecosystem.
*   **Utilities & Testing:** Common Go utilities for retries (`github.com/avast/retry-go`), backoff (`github.com/cenkalti/backoff/v4`), concurrency (`github.com/panjf2000/ants/v2`), error handling (`github.com/pkg/errors`), UUID generation (`github.com/satori/go.uuid`), and testing (`github.com/alicebob/miniredis/v2`, `github.com/stretchr/testify`). CLI tools `github.com/spf13/cobra` and `github.com/spf13/viper` are also present for application configuration and command-line interfaces.

**Timestamp of significant changes:**

The single log entry indicates the `go.mod` file's state as of `10/3/2025, 11:42:09 AM`. Notably, the `github.com/tink-ab/tink-grpc` dependency is specified with a pseudo-version timestamp of `20251003093246`, which closely aligns with the `go.mod` file's timestamp. This suggests that this internal gRPC library was either recently updated or specifically pinned around the time this `go.mod` file was last modified or generated.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**

*   **Microservices Architecture:** The heavy reliance on gRPC, messaging (Sarama for Kafka), and a variety of database clients strongly suggests a microservices-oriented architecture for the transaction service, allowing it to interact with different data stores and other services.
*   **Robustness and Reliability:** The inclusion of libraries like `retry-go` and `backoff/v4` indicates an emphasis on building resilient systems that can handle transient failures.
*   **Comprehensive Observability:** The extensive DataDog dependencies highlight a commitment to monitoring, tracing, and logging for operational visibility.
*   **Internal Ecosystem Integration:** Dependencies on `tink-accounts-api` and `tink-grpc` confirm that this service is an integral part of a larger, internally developed suite of applications within Tink.
*   **Modern Go Development:** The use of Go 1.23 and a recent toolchain, along with well-maintained third-party modules, points to modern development practices.
*   **Diverse Data Persistence:** The service interacts with a wide range of data technologies, implying a varied data landscape or specific needs for different data types.

## 1:44:14 PM
The changes primarily affect the `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_transaction_mapper.go` file, which is responsible for mapping transaction objects between different protobuf definitions (`transactionpb.Transaction` to `internal_transactionpb.Transaction`).

**Key File-Specific Updates:**

*   **10/3/2025, 1:14:09 PM:** This timestamp represents the initial or a stable version of the file. It contains a comprehensive set of functions for converting various aspects of a `Transaction` object, including amounts, dates, timestamps (with ISO8601 formatting for specific markets), identifiers, types, status, merchant information, mutability, and counterparties. Notable functions involved in type conversion are `convertTypes` and `convertType`, though `convertTypes` in this version does not map the main `Type` field but only `FinancialInstitutionTypeCode`, and `convertType` has an unusual `in` parameter type of `transactionpb.Transaction` (the entire transaction object) rather than a specific transaction type enum.

*   **10/3/2025, 1:20:52 PM:** This update introduces changes aimed at handling transaction types more thoroughly:
    *   The `convertTypes` function was modified to include the mapping of the main transaction `Type` field by calling `convertType(ctx, in.Type, logger)`.
    *   A new line `type :=in.Type.getType()` was added within `convertTypes`, which appears to be erroneous due to the redeclaration of the `type` keyword and a call to a likely non-existent `getType()` method.
    *   The `convertType` function's `in` parameter type was changed from `transactionpb.Transaction` to `*transactionpb.Transaction.Transaction_Type`. This new type definition appears to be syntactically incorrect, making the function signature problematic. The return type also shifted to `transactionpb.Transaction_Type`.

*   **10/3/2025, 1:25:46 PM:** This subsequent update further refines the type conversion logic:
    *   In `convertTypes`, the erroneous line `type :=in.Type.getType()` was modified to `transaction_type := in.Type.getType()`. While fixing the keyword redeclaration, it still retains the call to the potentially non-existent `getType()` method.
    *   The `convertType` function's `in` parameter type was corrected from the syntactically invalid `*transactionpb.Transaction.Transaction_Type` to the more appropriate `transactionpb.Transaction_Type`. However, the return values within the switch statement (`transactionpb.Transaction_Types_UNDEFINED`, `_DEFAULT`, etc.) still refer to `transactionpb.Transaction_Types_Type` members, which might be inconsistent with the `transactionpb.Transaction_Type` return type.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent File Focus:** All logged changes are confined to the `internal_transaction_mapper.go` file, indicating focused development on this specific mapping logic.
*   **Type Conversion Refinement:** The primary pattern observed is the iterative modification and bug-fixing around the `convertTypes` and `convertType` functions. This highlights an ongoing effort to correctly and robustly map transaction type enums between different protobuf schemas.
*   **Protobuf and Wrapper Usage:** The codebase extensively utilizes Go's protobuf libraries, including `google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/wrapperspb` and `github.com/golang/protobuf/ptypes`, to handle protobuf-specific types and wrappers for optional fields.
*   **Defensive Programming:** Numerous `nil` checks are present throughout the code (e.g., `if in == nil`, `if in.Dates == nil`, `if geoLocation == nil`) to prevent panics and ensure data integrity during mapping.
*   **Date/Time Standardization:** A significant portion of the mapper functions deals with converting various date and timestamp formats (including proto timestamps and custom date structs) into standardized `wrappers.StringValue` or ISO8601 strings.

## 2:44:21 PM
The project utilizes Go to implement a GRPC transaction service, primarily focusing on mapping between different protobuf representations of transaction data.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_transaction_mapper.go`**
    *   **Initial State (10/3/2025, 1:54:53 PM):** This file provides the core logic for converting a `transactionpb.Transaction` into an `internal_transactionpb.Transaction`. It includes comprehensive mapping functions for various transaction attributes, such as IDs, amounts, descriptions, dates (including ISO8601 timestamps conditionally for "GB" or "UK" markets), identifiers, types, status, merchant details (category, name, geolocation, address), mutability, and counterparties. The `convertMerchantInformation` function handles nested merchant location and address details, returning `nil` if all merchant-related fields are empty.
    *   **First Update (10/3/2025, 2:36:03 PM):** The `convertMerchantInformation` function was modified to incorporate a `MerchantId` field. The condition for returning `nil` was updated to also check if `in.MerchantId == nil`, and the `MerchantId` was mapped to the new `MerchantNationalId` field within the `internal_transactionpb.Transaction_MerchantInformation` structure.
    *   **Second Update (10/3/2025, 2:38:19 PM):** A subsequent change to `convertMerchantInformation` in the same file occurred shortly after the first. The `in.MerchantId == nil` check was removed from the condition for returning `nil`. Additionally, the assignment of `MerchantNationalId` was changed from directly using `in.MerchantId` to wrapping it as `&wrapperspb.StringValue{Value: in.MerchantId}`, indicating a change in how `MerchantId` is sourced or expected, likely converting a simple string to a protobuf `StringValue` wrapper.

*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_transaction_mapper_test.go`**
    *   **Timestamp (10/3/2025, 2:03:21 PM):** This file contains unit tests for the `ConvertTransaction` function in `internal_transaction_mapper.go`. It uses a table-driven test approach, covering various scenarios like nil input, different currency amount configurations, external IDs from different sources (identifiers or payload), and detailed merchant information (including geolocation and address, with tests for both complete and null fields). The tests confirm the correct transformation of protobuf messages, including date/timestamp conversions to ISO8601 format and mapping of other complex structures.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The primary development activity observed in the logs occurred on **October 3, 2025**, with changes spanning from 1:54:53 PM to 2:38:19 PM, indicating focused work on the transaction mapper and its associated tests. Notably, there were rapid consecutive updates to `internal_transaction_mapper.go` at 2:36:03 PM and 2:38:19 PM, suggesting quick iterations or corrections related to the new `MerchantId` field.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Protobuf-centric Development:** The entire log revolves around Go code interacting with Google's Protobufs, specifically mapping between two versions or representations of a `Transaction` message.
*   **Extensive Data Mapping:** There's a strong pattern of detailed field-by-field mapping, including nested structures like `Dates`, `Timestamps`, `Identifiers`, `MerchantInformation`, and `Counterparties`.
*   **Robust Nil Handling:** Numerous `if nil` checks are consistently used across all conversion functions to safely handle potentially missing data in the input protobuf messages, preventing panics and ensuring graceful behavior.
*   **Date and Time Conversions:** A dedicated set of utility functions exists for converting various date and timestamp formats (protobuf `Timestamp`, custom `Date` structures, `time.Time`) into specific string representations (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD" or RFC3339/ISO8601).
*   **Wrapper Types:** The use of `wrapperspb.StringValue` and `wrapperspb.DoubleValue` is prevalent for optional primitive fields in protobuf messages, allowing for explicit representation of nullability.
*   **Testing Coverage:** The presence of a comprehensive test file (even if truncated) demonstrates a commitment to ensuring the correctness and reliability of the mapping logic across diverse input scenarios.
