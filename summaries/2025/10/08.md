# Activity Summary for 10/8/2025

## 7:17:50 AM
The log primarily features updates to a single file, `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/golden-receiver/proto/golden_receiver.proto`, across three closely spaced timestamps on `10/7/2025` at `10:49:05 PM`, `10:51:01 PM`, and `10:51:07 PM`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/golden-receiver/proto/golden_receiver.proto`**: This Protobuf definition file, belonging to the `tink.goldenreceiver` package, defines a `GoldenReceiver` gRPC service. It includes several RPC methods for managing financial data:
    *   **Transaction Management**: `IngestTransactions`, `UpdateTransactions`, `DeleteTransactions` (for batch operations), and `Operations` (to get the status of an operation). These methods primarily use POST requests, except `Operations` which is a GET request, and return `OperationResponse` or `GetOperationResponse`.
    *   **Account Management**: `IngestAccounts`, `UpdateAccounts`, and `DeleteAccounts`. These methods use POST (ingest/delete) and PATCH (update) requests and return `google.protobuf.Empty`.
    *   All RPCs are extensively annotated with `google.api.http` options for RESTful mapping and `grpc.gateway.protoc_gen_swagger.options.openapiv2_operation` for OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.
    *   The OpenAPI definition specifies a "Connector v2 Product" API with version "1.0.0alpha", consumes and produces "application/json".
    *   Security is defined via "OAuth2Client" with `transactions:write` and `accounts:write` scopes.
    *   Common response codes (202, 204, 400, 401, 403) are defined for various scenarios.
    *   Each RPC operation is tagged with "Data v2.Connector.Transactions" or "Data v2.Connector.Accounts", "REGION.US", "ALPHA", and "MULTI_TENANT".
    *   A `Transaction` message is partially defined, requiring `externalTransactionId`, `amount`, and `descriptions`, and includes an example JSON string.

**Significant Timestamps:**

*   The initial version was logged at `10/7/2025, 10:49:05 PM`.
*   Subsequent entries at `10/7/2025, 10:51:01 PM` and `10/7/2025, 10:51:07 PM` show **no content changes** in the provided snippets. This suggests either minor, uncaptured changes (like whitespace) or saves without functional modifications occurred within a span of approximately two minutes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Standardized API Definition**: The extensive use of `protoc-gen-swagger` and `google.api.annotations` indicates a strong pattern of generating a well-documented and RESTful API from a gRPC service.
*   **Security Model**: All operations enforce "OAuth2Client" security with granular scopes (`transactions:write`, `accounts:write`).
*   **Response Handling**: Consistent error response descriptions (400, 401, 403) are defined across most RPCs.
*   **Categorization Tags**: The recurring use of tags like "REGION.US", "ALPHA", and "MULTI_TENANT" points to a structured approach for categorizing and managing API endpoints.
*   **Data v2 Connector**: The API endpoints consistently use the `/data/v2/connector/` prefix, indicating a versioned and modular approach to the connector's data interface.
*   **Operations-Based Processing**: The return type `OperationResponse` for transaction-related calls implies an asynchronous or long-running operation model, with a separate `Operations` RPC to check status.
