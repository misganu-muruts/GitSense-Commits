# Activity Summary for 10/29/2025

## 8:12:49 AM
The changes primarily revolve around a significant refactoring and optimization of the transaction listing functionality within the `transaction-service`, particularly for the `internal/grpc` and `cassandra` packages. This effort is largely focused on improving performance and adopting a more scalable pagination strategy for Cassandra.

**`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go`**:
This file undergoes the most substantial evolution.
*   **Early Changes (10/24/2025)**: Initially, the `ListTransactions` gRPC endpoint used a simpler offset-based pagination and applied filters after fetching a potentially large set of transactions. The conversion from Cassandra objects to internal V2 protobufs was handled by `cassandra.ToV2Internal`. A notable change was the renaming of the conversion function to `cassandra.FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal` on **10/24/2025, 8:52:30 AM**.
*   **Cursor-Based Pagination (from 10/28/2025, 8:24:59 AM)**: A major overhaul began with the introduction of `PaginationCursor` and related helper functions (`decodeCursor`, `encodeCursor`), indicating a shift to cursor-based pagination. This aims to fetch transactions more efficiently from Cassandra across multiple periods. The `ListTransactions` method was refactored to use this new pagination flow, including calculating relevant Cassandra periods from date ranges and making calls to a new `fetchTransactionsWithCursor` helper.
*   **Repository Interface Update (10/28/2025, 1:33:36 PM)**: The `cassandraRepository` interface was extended to include `FindByUserIDAndPeriodWithCursor`, signaling the new required data access pattern for efficient pagination.
*   **Filtering Optimization (10/28/2025, 1:40:28 PM)**: A new `applyV1Filters` function was introduced. This is a critical optimization, designed to filter raw Cassandra transactions *before* the more expensive conversion to internal V2 protobufs.
*   **Detailed Flow Documentation (10/28/2025, 1:47:16 PM)**: A comprehensive block comment was added to the `ListTransactions` function, outlining the new optimized flow for cursor-based pagination, including Cassandra queries with cursor limits, early filtering (`applyV1Filters`), sorting, and cursor generation.
*   **Interface Refinement (10/28/2025, 3:10:14 PM & 10/29/2025, 7:40:38 AM & 7:54:07 AM)**: The `FindByUserIDAndPeriodWithCursor` method in the `cassandraRepository` interface was changed to return `[]*cassandra.CassandraTransaction` (raw objects) instead of `[]*transactionpb.Transaction` (protobufs), further reinforcing the strategy of filtering raw data first. Over subsequent updates, `FindByUserID` and `FindByUserIDAndPeriods` methods were removed from the interface within the `/* START GENAI */` block, streamlining the Cassandra access methods for the internal gRPC service towards cursor-based and ID-specific fetches.
*   **New Constant (10/28/2025, 3:34:37 PM)**: `DefaultStartDate = "2000-01-01"` was added for date range calculations.
*   **Sorting Import (10/28/2025, 4:11:41 PM)**: The `sort` package was imported, likely to facilitate the sorting of Cassandra transactions by date.

**`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/cassandra/mapper.go`**:
*   **Logger Interface (10/24/2025, 8:53:08 AM)**: A `Logger` interface was defined, indicating an enhancement in logging capabilities and better dependency management within the Cassandra mapper.
*   **Conversion Function Renaming**: The `FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal` function is prominently used, indicating a specific conversion process from Cassandra's original transaction format to a new internal v2 format.

**`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/cassandra/repository.go`**:
*   **Cursor-Based Query Implementation (10/29/2025, 7:39:17 AM)**: This file received the crucial implementation of `FindByUserIDAndPeriodWithCursor`. This method directly queries Cassandra using `WHERE id > cursor LIMIT pageSize`, efficiently fetching transactions for a given user and period, starting from a specified transaction ID, and returning raw `CassandraTransaction` objects. This underpins the new pagination strategy implemented in the gRPC layer.

**`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server_filter_test.go`**:
*   **New Test File (10/29/2025, 7:51:35 AM)**: A new unit test file was introduced to rigorously test the new filtering and sorting logic, specifically `prepareFilterContext`, `applyCassandraFilters`, and `sortCassandraTransactionsByDate`. This demonstrates a focus on ensuring the correctness and efficiency of the new data processing pipeline.

**`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server_test.go`**:
*   **Mock Repository Update (10/29/2025, 8:02:24 AM)**: The `mockCassandraRepo` was updated to include a mock for `FindByUserIDAndPeriodWithCursorFn`, enabling the testing of the gRPC service's interaction with the new Cassandra pagination method without requiring a live Cassandra instance.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements**:
*   **Performance Optimization**: The recurring theme is the optimization of transaction fetching and processing, particularly by moving filtering earlier in the pipeline (before expensive object conversion) and implementing efficient cursor-based pagination at the database level (Cassandra).
*   **V2 Internal API Development**: The changes indicate ongoing development and refinement of a "V2 Internal" transaction service, distinguishing it from an older "V1" mechanism.
*   **Code Generation Markers**: The `/* START GENAI */` and `/* END GENAI */` comments consistently mark sections of new or significantly altered code across multiple files, suggesting these areas represent new feature development, possibly assisted by AI.
*   **Modular Design**: The introduction of new interfaces (e.g., `Logger`, `cassandraRepository` methods) and dedicated test files points to an emphasis on modularity, testability, and clear separation of concerns.

The logs show a focused development effort on optimizing and refactoring the transaction listing functionality within a gRPC service, primarily driven by the implementation of cursor-based pagination and efficient filtering for Cassandra-backed data.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go`**:
    *   Initial changes on **October 24, 2025, 8:52:30 AM**, involved renaming the Cassandra-to-V2 internal conversion function from `cassandra.ToV2Internal` to `cassandra.FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal`.
    *   A major refactoring began on **October 28, 2025, 8:24:59 AM**, introducing cursor-based pagination. This included importing `encoding/base64` and `encoding/json`, defining a new `PaginationCursor` struct, and overhauling the `ListTransactions` function to use this new pagination strategy.
    *   Further enhancements to the cursor-based pagination were made on **October 28, 2025, 1:33:36 PM**, by adding a `FindByUserIDAndPeriodWithCursor` method to the `cassandraRepository` interface and modifying the `ListTransactions` function to generate the next page token more efficiently.
    *   A significant optimization on **October 28, 2025, 3:10:14 PM**, changed the return type of `FindByUserIDAndPeriodWithCursor` in the `cassandraRepository` interface from gRPC protobuf transactions (`*transactionpb.Transaction`) to raw Cassandra transactions (`*cassandra.CassandraTransaction`), indicating a shift to convert data later in the processing pipeline.
    *   On **October 28, 2025, 3:34:37 PM**, a `DefaultStartDate` constant was introduced to `calculatePeriodsFromDateRange`.
    *   Between **October 28, 2025, 4:11:41 PM,** and **October 29, 2025, 7:40:38 AM**, the `sort` package was imported. The repository interface was streamlined by removing `FindByUserID` and `FindByUserIDAndPeriods` on **October 29, 2025, 7:45:31 AM,** reinforcing the adoption of the `FindByUserIDAndPeriodWithCursor` method. A `FilterContext` struct and `prepareFilterContext` function were introduced to optimize filtering, pre-processing request parameters into maps for O(1) lookups and parsing dates once.
    *   The `ListTransactions` request flow was extensively documented within the code with a multi-line comment block outlining the optimized cursor-based pagination process.

*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/cassandra/mapper.go`**:
