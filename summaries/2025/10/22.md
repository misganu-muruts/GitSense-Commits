# Activity Summary for 10/22/2025

## 11:24:57 AM
For the file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/elasticsearch/search.go`, a significant change occurred between 10/22/2025, 10:32:10 AM and 10/22/2025, 11:02:25 AM. The `propagateTimeout` function, responsible for propagating gRPC context deadlines to Elasticsearch queries, was updated. Initially, if the context deadline was already exceeded (`remainingTime <= 0`), it would create a new, immediately cancelled context and return it. The update changes this behavior to instead return the *original* context (which is already expired) along with a no-op cancel function, optimizing resource handling by avoiding the creation of an unnecessary new context.

For the file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/elasticsearch/search_test.go`, multiple entries are logged at 10/22/2025, 11:02:48 AM, 10/22/2025, 11:04:16 AM, and 10/22/2025, 11:11:26 AM. Upon inspection, the code content across these timestamps is identical. This indicates that there were no functional code changes made to this test file during these recorded times, only timestamp updates, possibly due to saving the file without modifications or an automated process.

**Key patterns and recurring elements across the changes include:**
*   **Go Language**: All code snippets are written in Go.
*   **Elasticsearch Integration**: Both files are part of an `elasticsearch` package, indicating core functionality related to interacting with an Elasticsearch cluster for transaction search, saving, and deletion.
*   **Context Management**: Extensive use of `context.Context` for cancellation and deadline propagation, particularly evident in the `propagateTimeout` function.
*   **gRPC and Protobuf**: Utilizes gRPC status codes (`google.golang.org/grpc/codes`, `google.golang.org/grpc/status`) and Protobuf definitions (`requestProto`, `proto`) for defining request/response structures and field masks.
*   **Error Handling and Recovery**: Features `failSafeSearch` for runtime error recovery and `errors.New` for custom error types.
*   **Observability**: Integration with `dd-trace-go` for tracing (via `tracer.StartSpanFromContext`) and `log/slog` for structured logging.
*   **Feature Toggles**: The `featuretoggle` package is used in tests to enable/disable specific functionalities like "temp-user-index" and "temp-user-processing".
*   **Testing Practices**: The `search_test.go` file demonstrates comprehensive testing of Elasticsearch operations (saving, deleting, searching) using `stretchr/testify` for assertions, including tests for sorting, field masking, and cursor-based pagination. It also includes setting up mock dependencies (`mockUserRepo`) and managing test indices.
