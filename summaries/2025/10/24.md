# Activity Summary for 10/24/2025

## 9:06:35 AM
The provided log details changes across two Go files within a "transaction-service" project, primarily focusing on gRPC service implementation and Cassandra data mapping. All modifications occurred on October 24, 2025, between 8:39 AM and 8:54 AM, indicating a concentrated development effort.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go`**

*   **Significant Changes (around 8:52:30 AM):** The primary update in this file involved renaming the transaction conversion function used when fetching data from Cassandra. Specifically, calls to `cassandra.ToV2Internal` were updated to `cassandra.FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal` within both the `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` gRPC handler methods. This change clarifies that the conversion process explicitly handles transactions originating from Cassandra's v1 format to an internal v2 format.
*   **Overall Functionality:** This file defines the `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl`, which implements gRPC services for retrieving transaction data. It includes `GetTransaction` for single transaction retrieval and `ListTransactions` for fetching multiple transactions. The `ListTransactions` method supports advanced features such as date range filtering (by calculating Cassandra periods), account and transaction ID filtering, status filtering, sorting, and offset-based pagination with `maxPageSize` and `PageToken` handling. It leverages a `cassandraRepository` for data access.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/cassandra/mapper.go`**

*   **Significant Changes (around 8:53:08 AM and 8:53:42 AM):** A new Go interface named `Logger` was introduced to abstract logging operations, specifically for `Warn` level messages. Shortly after, a clarifying comment `// Logger interface for V2 mapper` was added above its definition. This suggests a move towards more explicit and dependency-injected logging, especially for data mapping and conversion logic.
*   **Overall Functionality:** This file is responsible for marshalling and unmarshalling transaction data between the service's internal protobuf representations (`proto.Transaction`, `internal_transactionpb.Transaction`) and Cassandra's native data structures (`CassandraTransaction`). It contains extensive helper functions (`toUuid`, `parsePeriod`, `serializeParts`, `deserializePayload`, `getMerchantGeolocLatitude`, etc.) to handle various data types, optional fields, and nested structures, ensuring correct data persistence and retrieval. The presence of a new `Logger` interface indicates that conversion functions, such as the `FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal` mentioned in `internal_server.go`, would likely integrate this logging mechanism.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **V1 to V2 Internal Conversion:** A clear pattern across both files is the focus on migrating or handling Cassandra v1 transaction data and converting it to a v2 internal format. The renaming of the conversion function in `internal_server.go` explicitly states this intent.
*   **Logging Integration:** The introduction of a `Logger` interface in `mapper.go` and the existing `logger` parameter in the `FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal` function (as seen in `internal_server.go` context) highlights a pattern of standardizing and improving logging practices, likely for better error handling and debugging during data transformations.
*   **Date and Period Handling:** Both files exhibit logic for handling dates, particularly for converting between standard date strings, protobuf timestamps, and Cassandra-specific "period" (YYYYMM) integers, crucial for efficient time-series data retrieval in Cassandra.
*   **Robust Data Mapping:** The `mapper.go` file demonstrates a comprehensive approach to mapping complex transaction data structures, including handling optional fields, nested objects (like `MerchantGeolocation`, `MerchantAddress`, `Counterparty`), and various identifiers.

## 10:06:37 AM
The changes primarily focus on enhancing the internal gRPC transaction service, specifically related to how transaction data is retrieved, filtered, and converted from Cassandra, indicating a push towards a V2 internal API.

### File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go`

*   **Initial State (10/24/2025, 8:39:54 AM and 8:40:00 AM):** This file defines the `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl` responsible for handling internal gRPC requests for transactions. It includes methods like `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions`.
    *   `GetTransaction` retrieves a single transaction by user ID and transaction ID, using `t.cassandraRepo.GetTransactionsByUserIdAndIdsWithPeriods` and then converting the Cassandra result to an internal V2 format via `cassandra.ToV2Internal`.
    *   `ListTransactions` supports fetching transactions with various filters (date range, account IDs, transaction IDs, status), sorting, and pagination. It calculates Cassandra periods from date ranges for efficient retrieval and also uses `cassandra.ToV2Internal` for conversion.
    *   The service integrates with DataDog for tracing (`tracer.StartSpanFromContext`).
*   **Update (10/24/2025, 8:52:30 AM):** The primary change in this file is the renaming of the Cassandra transaction conversion function. `cassandra.ToV2Internal` has been updated to `cassandra.FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal` in both the `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` methods. This suggests a more explicit handling or migration process for converting existing Cassandra v1 data into the v2 internal transaction format.

### File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/cassandra/mapper.go`

*   **Initial State (10/24/2025, 8:52:44 AM):** This new file introduces comprehensive mapping logic between the protobuf `proto.Transaction` and the Cassandra-specific `CassandraTransaction` types.
    *   It contains `ToCassandra` for converting protobuf to Cassandra format and `FromCassandra` for the reverse, handling various fields including IDs, amounts, dates, descriptions, and nested structures like counterparty information and merchant geolocation/address.
    *   Extensive helper functions are defined for UUID parsing, timestamp conversions, payload serialization/deserialization, and safe handling of optional fields.
*   **Updates (10/24/2025, 8:53:08 AM, 8:53:42 AM, and 8:54:05 AM):**
    *   **8:53:08 AM:** A `Logger` interface is introduced, defining a `Warn` method. This indicates an intention to integrate logging capabilities directly into the mapping logic, likely to report issues during data conversion without halting the process.
    *   **8:53:42 AM:** A comment `// Logger interface for V2 mapper` is added to the newly defined `Logger` interface, clarifying its purpose.
    *   **8:54:05 AM:** No functional changes from the previous entry; likely a save operation.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements

*   **V2 Internal API Development:** There is a clear pattern of developing and refining a V2 internal API for transactions. The `internal_v2` protobuf imports and the explicit naming `FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal` strongly suggest a staged migration or coexistence strategy for new and old data formats.
*   **Cassandra as Primary Data Source:** Both files heavily rely on Cassandra for transaction storage, with optimizations for querying by user ID and date periods.
*   **Data Transformation:** A core theme is the complex transformation of data between different representations (gRPC protobufs and Cassandra models), involving detailed field mapping, serialization, and deserialization.
*   **Observability and Error Handling:** The inclusion of Datadog tracing (`tracer.StartSpanFromContext`) and consistent gRPC status error handling (`status.Errorf`) point to a robust approach to monitoring and error management. The introduction of a `Logger` interface in the mapper also supports better debugging and operational insight during data conversion.
*   **Date-Based Operations:** Transactions are heavily filtered and retrieved based on dates, with logic to derive Cassandra periods (YYYYMM) from date ranges.
