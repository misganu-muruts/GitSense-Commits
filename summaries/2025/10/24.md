# Activity Summary for 10/24/2025

## 9:06:35 AM
The provided log details changes across two Go files within a "transaction-service" project, primarily focusing on gRPC service implementation and Cassandra data mapping. All modifications occurred on October 24, 2025, between 8:39 AM and 8:54 AM, indicating a concentrated development effort.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go`**

*   **Significant Changes (around 8:52:30 AM):** The primary update in this file involved renaming the transaction conversion function used when fetching data from Cassandra. Specifically, calls to `cassandra.ToV2Internal` were updated to `cassandra.FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal` within both the `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` gRPC handler methods. This change clarifies that the conversion process explicitly handles transactions originating from Cassandra's v1 format to an internal v2 format.
*   **Overall Functionality:** This file defines the `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl`, which implements gRPC services for retrieving transaction data. It includes `GetTransaction` for single transaction retrieval and `ListTransactions` for fetching multiple transactions. The `ListTransactions` method supports advanced features such as date range filtering (by calculating Cassandra periods), account and transaction ID filtering, status filtering, sorting, and offset-based pagination with `maxPageSize` and `PageToken` handling. It leverages a `cassandraRepository` for data access.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/cassandra/mapper.go`**

*   **Significant Changes (around 8:53:08 AM and 8:53:42 AM):** A new Go interface named `Logger` was introduced to abstract logging operations, specifically for `Warn` level messages. Shortly after, a clarifying comment `// Logger interface for V2 mapper` was added above its definition. This suggests a move towards more explicit and dependency-injected logging, especially for data mapping and conversion logic.
*   **Overall Functionality:** This file is responsible for marshalling and unmarshalling transaction data between the service's internal protobuf representations (`proto.Transaction`, `internal_transactionpb.Transaction`) and Cassandra's native data structures (`CassandraTransaction`). It contains extensive helper functions (`toUuid`, `parsePeriod`, `serializeParts`, `deserializePayload`, `getMerchantGeolocLatitude`, etc.) to handle various data types, optional fields, and nested structures, ensuring correct data persistence and retrieval. The presence of a new `Logger` interface indicates that conversion functions, such as the `FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal` mentioned in `internal_server.go`, would likely integrate this logging mechanism.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **V1 to V2 Internal Conversion:** A clear pattern across both files is the focus on migrating or handling Cassandra v1 transaction data and converting it to a v2 internal format. The renaming of the conversion function in `internal_server.go` explicitly states this intent.
*   **Logging Integration:** The introduction of a `Logger` interface in `mapper.go` and the existing `logger` parameter in the `FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal` function (as seen in `internal_server.go` context) highlights a pattern of standardizing and improving logging practices, likely for better error handling and debugging during data transformations.
*   **Date and Period Handling:** Both files exhibit logic for handling dates, particularly for converting between standard date strings, protobuf timestamps, and Cassandra-specific "period" (YYYYMM) integers, crucial for efficient time-series data retrieval in Cassandra.
*   **Robust Data Mapping:** The `mapper.go` file demonstrates a comprehensive approach to mapping complex transaction data structures, including handling optional fields, nested objects (like `MerchantGeolocation`, `MerchantAddress`, `Counterparty`), and various identifiers.
