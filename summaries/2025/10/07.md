# Activity Summary for 10/7/2025

The file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/golden-receiver/service/transaction_logic.go` was logged three times at 10/6/2025, 10:18:20 PM, 10:18:41 PM, and 10:20:05 PM. Despite the multiple entries, the content of the file remained identical across all timestamps. This file, `transaction_logic.go`, implements core business logic for a "golden-receiver" service, handling the ingestion, updating, and partial deletion of transactions. Key functionalities include:
*   **Transaction Ingestion and Update:** Functions `IngestTransactions` and `UpdateTransactions` both delegate to `IngestOrUpdateTransactions`. This central function processes user requests, performs validations such as checking for duplicate `externalUserId`s, fetching associated user and account information, and validating individual transactions. It aggregates valid transactions for processing.
*   **Error Handling and Status Reporting:** The code heavily uses an `operation` object (`goldenreceiverpb.GetOperationResponse`) to track the status of each user's transaction processing, including collecting exceptions and setting user statuses (e.g., failed state `Status = 2`). Specific errors are handled, such as missing users/accounts or duplicate external user IDs.
*   **Integration Points:** It interacts with external services for authentication (`srv.authClient`), user information (`srv.userServiceClient`), and publishing messages to SNS (`srv.snsClient`) for reconciliation. It also stores `TransactionsExternalId`s in Cassandra (`srv.cassandraRepo`).
*   **Feature Toggles:** The `featuretoggle.SendSnsMessageToggle` is used to conditionally send SNS messages.
*   **Transaction Deletion:** The `DeleteTransactions` function handles requests to remove transactions. It retrieves user and account information, validates the delete request, and maps external transaction IDs to internal ones. The provided log for this function appears to be truncated.

The file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/golden-receiver/Makefile` was logged at 10/6/2025, 10:37:33 PM. This Makefile orchestrates the build and development workflow for the `golden-receiver` Go project. Its key capabilities include:
*   **Protobuf Generation:** Commands (`install-proto-plugins`, `build-proto`) are defined to install necessary `protoc-gen-go` plugins and compile Protobuf definitions (`golden_receiver.proto`, `user/user.proto`) into Go code, gRPC service definitions, and Swagger documentation.
*   **Dependency Management:** `mod` and `deps` targets manage Go module dependencies.
*   **Build Operations:** Targets for `build` (for Linux) and `build-local` (for the local OS) compile the Go application.
*   **Development Utilities:** Includes targets for `clean` (removing generated files), `run` (running the application with a `config.yaml`), `test`, `test_verbose`, `lint` (using `golangci-lint`), and `benchmark`.
*   **Local Environment Setup:** Targets `local-deps-up`/`down` use `docker compose` to manage local service dependencies, while `podman-local-deps-up`/`down` provide equivalent functionality using `podman compose`. A `run-local` target uses a `config_local.yaml`.

A recurring pattern observed is that all changes were logged on the same date, 10/6/2025. The `transaction_logic.go` file consistently shows a detailed implementation of business logic involving extensive validation, error handling, and integration with various internal and external components, highlighting the complexity of transaction processing. The `Makefile` reflects a comprehensive and automated development environment, supporting proto generation, builds, testing, and local dependency management using container orchestration tools.
