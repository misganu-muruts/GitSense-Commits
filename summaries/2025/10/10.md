# Activity Summary for 10/10/2025

## 10:52:24 AM
The file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/commands/es_service_cmd/esservice.go`, updated on 10/10/2025, 10:32:49 AM, defines the main entry point and setup for a gRPC server within a transaction service.

Key information from these changes includes:

*   **Core Service Initialization:** The `serveWithES` function orchestrates the initialization of a complex microservice, starting a gRPC server that handles transaction storage and internal transaction services.
*   **Extensive Dependency Integration:** The service integrates with a wide array of internal and external components:
    *   **Data Stores:** Elasticsearch/OpenSearch (via `CompositeSearchClient`), Cassandra (for transaction storage and a potential V2 setup), and Redis for search result caching.
    *   **Messaging Systems:** Kafka (for a deletion listener and a Dead Letter Queue producer) and AWS SNS (for transaction mutations).
    *   **AWS Services:** Secret Manager for secure credential management.
    *   **Monitoring/Tracing:** Datadog for tracing (`tracer.Start()`).
*   **Configuration Flexibility:** The service leverages `cobra` for command-line arguments, allowing extensive configuration via flags for:
    *   Elasticsearch index ranges, gRPC server listen addresses, TLS paths, and concurrency limits.
    *   User and account service endpoints and CAs.
    *   Kafka broker details, topic names (deletion, DLQ), and TLS settings.
    *   Redis host, TTL, and minimum response transaction numbers.
    *   Detailed Cassandra (including V2 settings) and main database credentials for data retention.
*   **Conditional Feature Enablement:** Many functionalities are conditionally activated based on configuration flags or feature toggles, such as:
    *   Redis caching (`redis-enabled`).
    *   Secret Manager (`secret-manager-enabled`).
    *   SNS client (`sns-enabled`).
    *   A Kafka deletion listener (`kafka-deletion-listener-enabled`, which is disabled if a `runID` is present).
    *   A Data Retention Service (`data-retention-enabled`) with extensive database and Cassandra configuration.
    *   Creation of a temporary user index policy in OpenSearch/Elasticsearch (`featuretoggle.TempUserIndexToggle.IsEnabled()`).
*   **Graceful Shutdown:** The service includes logic to gracefully shut down upon receiving OS signals (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, `SIGHUP`), ensuring proper termination of the gRPC server.
*   **Logging:** `slog` and a custom logger are used for structured logging, with configurable log levels.

A recurring pattern is the heavy reliance on command-line flags and feature toggles to enable or disable and configure various integrated services and functionalities. This indicates a highly modular and configurable architecture designed for flexibility in different deployment environments and operational scenarios.
