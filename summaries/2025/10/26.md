# Activity Summary for 10/26/2025

## 10:15:03 AM
The `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go` file underwent functional changes around **10/24/2025, 8:52:30 AM**. Previously, at **8:39:54 AM** and **8:40:00 AM**, the `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` gRPC methods within the `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl` were using a Cassandra conversion function named `cassandra.ToV2Internal`. At **8:52:30 AM**, this function call was consistently updated in both methods to `cassandra.FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal`, indicating a rename or refactoring of the transaction data conversion logic from Cassandra's v1 format to an internal v2 format.

Concurrently, the `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/cassandra/mapper.go` file, responsible for mapping between Cassandra and Protobuf transaction structures, saw updates. At **10/24/2025, 8:52:44 AM**, the file showed its initial structure with `ToCassandra` and `FromCassandra` functions and various helper conversions. A significant change occurred at **10/24/2025, 8:53:08 AM** with the introduction of a `Logger` interface, defining a `Warn` method. This new interface was then given a clarifying comment "Logger interface for V2 mapper" at **10/24/2025, 8:53:42 AM**. The final logged state for this file at **8:54:05 AM** was identical to the previous one, signifying no further changes in the immediate sequence.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Transaction Service Evolution:** The changes indicate an ongoing development or refactoring of a transaction service, specifically around how transaction data is managed and presented through different API versions (v1 and internal v2).
*   **Data Transformation:** A strong emphasis is placed on the conversion and mapping of transaction data between a Cassandra database's internal `CassandraTransaction` structure and various Protobuf representations (`proto.Transaction`, `internal_transactionpb.Transaction`).
*   **Modularization and Observability:** The introduction of a `Logger` interface suggests a move towards more robust logging practices, likely to be utilized within the newly referenced `FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal` function to provide better debugging and monitoring capabilities. Distributed tracing with `dd-trace-go.v1` is already in place.
*   **Consistent Data Filtering and Pagination:** The `ListTransactions` method in `internal_server.go` demonstrates a comprehensive approach to handling transaction retrieval requests, including date-based period calculation for optimized Cassandra queries, general filtering, sorting, and offset-based pagination.
