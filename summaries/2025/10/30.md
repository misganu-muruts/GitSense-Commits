# Activity Summary for 10/30/2025

## 8:38:24 AM
The changes primarily focus on implementing and testing a dual-read strategy for transaction data, shifting from Elasticsearch to Cassandra v1 for internal v2 API calls, managed via a feature toggle and leveraging cursor-based pagination for Cassandra.

In `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go`, significant architectural changes were introduced around 10/29/2025, 9:04:34 PM. A `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag was added to the `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl` to conditionally route requests. The `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` methods now check this flag to decide between fetching data from Cassandra or Elasticsearch. New `getTransactionFromCassandra` and `listTransactionsFromCassandra` functions were implemented. The Cassandra-based list function (`listTransactionsFromCassandra`) incorporates a cursor-based pagination strategy, including a `PaginationCursor` struct for tracking `LastPeriod` and `LastTransactionID`, and a `cassandraRepository` interface defining methods for fetching transactions by IDs and by period with a cursor. This function handles parsing cursors, calculating periods, fetching data, applying filters, sorting, and converting Cassandra v1 transactions to the v2 internal format. A subsequent change at 10/29/2025, 9:04:54 PM completed the `ListTransactions` method, explicitly assigning the conditional routing to either `listTransactionsFromCassandra` or `listTransactionsFromElasticsearch`.

The file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server_test.go` was updated around 10/29/2025, 9:32:11 PM to include a `mockCassandraRepo` for testing the new Cassandra data access layer. `Test_GetTransaction` and `Test_ListTransactions` were added to validate the Cassandra-backed transaction fetching. These tests specifically enable the `"fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2"` feature toggle to ensure the Cassandra path is exercised. They cover scenarios like valid requests, missing user/transaction IDs, and "not found" cases, using mocked Cassandra responses.

Concurrently, at 10/29/2025, 9:43:03 PM, the file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/featuretoggle/feature_toggle.go` was modified to introduce a new feature toggle, `FetchV1FromCassandraForV2Toggle`. This toggle provides the `IsEnabled()` method, which queries the Unleash feature flag system for `"fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2"`, directly controlling the behavior of the `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag in the `internal_server.go` service.

A recurring pattern is the use of `/* START GENAI */` and `/* END GENAI */` comments, which surround newly introduced structures and functions related to Cassandra integration and pagination in both the core service and its tests, suggesting the use of a Generative AI tool in their development. The overarching theme is a strategic migration or dual-read capability to fetch transaction data from Cassandra v1 to serve internal v2 APIs, carefully controlled by feature flags and implemented with advanced pagination techniques.

## 9:38:22 AM
The provided log details changes exclusively for the `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/tink-backend/README.md` file. The entries span a period from 10/30/2025, 8:41:56 AM to 10/30/2025, 8:52:56 AM.

**File-Specific Updates:**
For the `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/tink-backend/README.md` file, there were no actual content changes recorded throughout the provided log. The content of the file remained identical across all timestamps.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
No significant changes to the file's content were identified within this log. All timestamps (10/30/2025, 8:41:56 AM; 10/30/2025, 8:42:09 AM; 10/30/2025, 8:42:28 AM; 10/30/2025, 8:51:43 AM; 10/30/2025, 8:52:18 AM; 10/30/2025, 8:52:30 AM; 10/30/2025, 8:52:41 AM; 10/30/2025, 8:52:56 AM) show the exact same content.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in Content:**
The content of the `README.md` file outlines a comprehensive guide for working with the `tink-backend` repository. Key recurring themes and elements within the README include:

*   **Bazel as the primary build tool:** Bazel is consistently mentioned for building, testing, and running services. Instructions detail its installation, configuration (`BUILD`, `WORKSPACE`, `.bazelrc`, `.bazelproject` files), and usage for various tasks.
*   **Minikube for local infrastructure:** All services are stated to run their infrastructure dependencies (like databases) inside minikube. Setup steps for minikube drivers (Docker, HyperKit, KVM2, VirtualBox) and commands to start resources within it are prominent.
*   **Cross-platform support:** Installation prerequisites are provided for both macOS (including M1-specific considerations) and Linux, often leveraging Homebrew.
*   **Extensive Internal Documentation:** A "Table of READMEs" lists numerous specialized README files (`CONTRIBUTING`, `README_BAZEL`, `README_BEGINNER`, `README_GIT`, `README_KAFKA`, etc.), indicating a strong emphasis on internal guidelines and documentation.
*   **Go Language Integration:** Specific guidelines for programming with Go are included, covering `go build`, Go modules (`go.mod`), Bazel integration with `Gazelle`, and steps for setting up new Go projects.
*   **Authentication and Dependency Management:** Steps for authenticating towards ECR (Elastic Container Registry) and Tink's jFrog repository are detailed, along with mentioning GitHub Packages for some targets.

The logs primarily serve as snapshots of the `README.md` content at specific times, demonstrating its stable state during the captured period.
