# Activity Summary for 10/30/2025

## 8:38:24 AM
The changes primarily focus on implementing and testing a dual-read strategy for transaction data, shifting from Elasticsearch to Cassandra v1 for internal v2 API calls, managed via a feature toggle and leveraging cursor-based pagination for Cassandra.

In `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go`, significant architectural changes were introduced around 10/29/2025, 9:04:34 PM. A `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag was added to the `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl` to conditionally route requests. The `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` methods now check this flag to decide between fetching data from Cassandra or Elasticsearch. New `getTransactionFromCassandra` and `listTransactionsFromCassandra` functions were implemented. The Cassandra-based list function (`listTransactionsFromCassandra`) incorporates a cursor-based pagination strategy, including a `PaginationCursor` struct for tracking `LastPeriod` and `LastTransactionID`, and a `cassandraRepository` interface defining methods for fetching transactions by IDs and by period with a cursor. This function handles parsing cursors, calculating periods, fetching data, applying filters, sorting, and converting Cassandra v1 transactions to the v2 internal format. A subsequent change at 10/29/2025, 9:04:54 PM completed the `ListTransactions` method, explicitly assigning the conditional routing to either `listTransactionsFromCassandra` or `listTransactionsFromElasticsearch`.

The file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server_test.go` was updated around 10/29/2025, 9:32:11 PM to include a `mockCassandraRepo` for testing the new Cassandra data access layer. `Test_GetTransaction` and `Test_ListTransactions` were added to validate the Cassandra-backed transaction fetching. These tests specifically enable the `"fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2"` feature toggle to ensure the Cassandra path is exercised. They cover scenarios like valid requests, missing user/transaction IDs, and "not found" cases, using mocked Cassandra responses.

Concurrently, at 10/29/2025, 9:43:03 PM, the file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/featuretoggle/feature_toggle.go` was modified to introduce a new feature toggle, `FetchV1FromCassandraForV2Toggle`. This toggle provides the `IsEnabled()` method, which queries the Unleash feature flag system for `"fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2"`, directly controlling the behavior of the `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag in the `internal_server.go` service.

A recurring pattern is the use of `/* START GENAI */` and `/* END GENAI */` comments, which surround newly introduced structures and functions related to Cassandra integration and pagination in both the core service and its tests, suggesting the use of a Generative AI tool in their development. The overarching theme is a strategic migration or dual-read capability to fetch transaction data from Cassandra v1 to serve internal v2 APIs, carefully controlled by feature flags and implemented with advanced pagination techniques.

## 9:38:29 AM
The log details a series of concentrated changes focused on enhancing transaction retrieval and listing capabilities, primarily by introducing and integrating Cassandra as a data source alongside an existing Elasticsearch solution, controlled by a feature toggle.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go (10/29/2025, 9:04:34 PM & 9:04:54 PM):**
    *   Introduced `PaginationCursor` and `cassandraRepository` interface, defining methods for fetching transactions by IDs and by user/period with a cursor.
    *   The `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl` now conditionally serves `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` requests from either Cassandra or Elasticsearch, based on the `readCassandraV1AsV2` feature flag.
    *   A new `listTransactionsFromCassandra` function implements complex cursor-based pagination logic, including parsing cursors, calculating periods, fetching transactions by period, filtering, sorting, and encoding the next page token. This indicates a significant architectural change for data retrieval.
    *   The two timestamps for this file show very similar content, with the second likely being a minor update or re-commit of the first, possibly completing a truncated section from the prior log entry, without introducing new functional changes.

*   **/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server_test.go (10/29/2025, 9:32:11 PM):**
    *   A `mockCassandraRepo` was added, providing mock implementations for `GetTransactionsByUserIDAndIDsWithPeriodsFn` and `FindByUserIDAndPeriodWithCursorFn`, which are crucial for testing the new Cassandra integration.
    *   New unit tests were added for the `GetTransaction` method, covering successful requests, validation failures (missing user/transaction IDs), and scenarios where a transaction is not found. These tests explicitly enable the `fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2` feature toggle to test the Cassandra-backed logic.
    *   Additional test structures for `ListTransactions` and `convertRequest` are present, demonstrating validation and request transformation for the broader transaction service.

*   **/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/featuretoggle/feature_toggle.go (10/29/2025, 9:43:03 PM):**
    *   A new feature toggle, `FetchV1FromCassandraForV2Toggle`, was implemented. Its `IsEnabled()` method checks the state of the "fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2" feature flag, which is used to control whether transaction data is read from Cassandra or Elasticsearch.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The changes occurred within a concentrated period on October 29, 2025, starting at 9:04:34 PM with the core Cassandra integration logic, followed by the addition of comprehensive tests at 9:32:11 PM, and the definition of the controlling feature toggle at 9:43:03 PM.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Cassandra Integration and Migration:** A dominant theme is the introduction and integration of Cassandra as a primary data source for internal transaction services. This includes specific interfaces (`cassandraRepository`), data conversion logic (`FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal`), and the ability to switch between Cassandra and Elasticsearch. This suggests an ongoing data source migration or a dual-read strategy.
*   **Feature Toggling:** The widespread use of an `Unleash` feature toggling system (`fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2`) allows for controlled rollout or A/B testing of the Cassandra-backed transaction retrieval. This pattern ensures flexibility and reduced risk in deploying new data sources.
*   **Cursor-Based Pagination:** The detailed implementation of cursor-based pagination for `ListTransactions` from Cassandra indicates a focus on efficient and scalable data retrieval for large datasets.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** The addition of mock repositories and thorough unit tests for the new features demonstrates a commitment to robust and reliable code, testing the new Cassandra path under various conditions.
*   **gRPC Service Enhancement:** The modifications are all within a gRPC service context, extending its capabilities for internal transaction management.
*   **Observability:** The consistent use of `tracer.StartSpanFromContext` indicates an adherence to distributed tracing for monitoring and debugging performance in the updated services.

## 9:53:37 AM
The primary change recorded occurred on `10/30/2025, 8:59:23 AM`, targeting the `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/api-docs/docs/BUILD` file.

This change to the Bazel `BUILD` file indicates a significant update to how API documentation (specifically Swagger/OpenAPI definitions) is compiled and deployed. The file defines rules for Go libraries and tests, and crucially, for Docker container images.

**Key updates in `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/api-docs/docs/BUILD`:**

*   **Expanded API Documentation Inclusion:** The `container_layer` named `swagger` has been substantially updated. It now includes a considerably larger set of Swagger definition files from various Tink services and backend components. This expansion covers a broad range of functionalities, including:
    *   `authentication_configuration_service`
    *   `tink/income_checks/v2`
    *   `tink/risk_insights`
    *   `tink/expense_checks/v1`
    *   `tink/merchants/v1`
    *   `tink/settlement_accounts/v1`
    *   `tink/settlement_account_payment_requests/v1`
    *   `tink/bulk_payments/v1`
    *   `tink/transaction_history/transactions/v2`
    *   `tink/transaction_history/reports/v2`
    *   `tink/golden_receiver`
    *   `se_tink_backend//src/budgets-bfm/api`
    *   `se_tink_backend//src/cash-flow/api/proto`
    *   `se_tink_backend//src/financial-calendar/api/proto`
    *   `se_tink_backend//src/link/proto/session/v1`
    *   `se_tink_backend//src/account/account-proxy/proxy/proto/v2`
    This comprehensive addition suggests a major effort to consolidate or update the API documentation for a wide array of services, potentially indicating new service releases or a push for more centralized and complete API specifications.
*   **Container Image Configuration:** A `container_image` named `image` is defined, built upon a Debian base, and includes an `entrypoint.sh` script, a merge utility, and integrates the newly expanded `swagger` layer.
*   **Docker Push Configuration:** A `container_push` rule named `docker_push` is set up to push this `image` to an AWS ECR registry (`784217881480.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/api-docs`) with a tag determined by `{GATEWAY_VERSION}`. This confirms the deployment target for the generated API documentation image.
*   **Go Library and Test Definitions:** The file also maintains definitions for a `go_library` (`merge.go`) responsible for documentation merging and a `go_test` (`merge_test.go`), indicating ongoing development and testing of the documentation generation process itself.

**Pattern:** The extensive list of `swagger` definitions and their frequent updates suggest a recurring pattern of integrating and consolidating API documentation as new services are developed or existing ones are updated within the Tink ecosystem. This `BUILD` file serves as a central point for orchestrating the inclusion of these definitions into a deployable API documentation image.

## 10:38:32 AM
The following outlines the key changes from the provided log:

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go`**

*   **Timestamp: 10/29/2025, 9:04:34 PM**
    *   Significant additions were made to support transaction fetching and listing from Cassandra V1 for the internal V2 API.
    *   Introduced `PaginationCursor` struct and `cassandraRepository` interface, specifically designed for cursor-based pagination across multiple Cassandra periods. These sections are marked with `/* START GENAI */` comments, suggesting AI assistance in their development.
    *   Added a detailed `listTransactionsFromCassandra` method, which includes logic for parsing pagination cursors, calculating relevant Cassandra periods, fetching transactions with cursor, applying filters, sorting results, and encoding the next page token. This method also handles the conversion of Cassandra V1 transactions to the V2 internal format and enriches them with account currency. A comprehensive comment block describes this new cursor-based pagination flow.
    *   The `GetTransaction` method was updated to conditionally delegate to either `getTransactionFromCassandra` or `getTransactionFromElasticsearch` based on the `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag, indicating a dual-read strategy.

*   **Timestamp: 10/29/2025, 9:04:54 PM**
    *   A minor update completed the `ListTransactions` function, adding the conditional routing logic to call either `listTransactionsFromCassandra` or `listTransactionsFromElasticsearch` based on the `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag. This was likely a completion of the logic partially present in the previous commit.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server_test.go`**

*   **Timestamp: 10/29/2025, 9:32:11 PM**
    *   Comprehensive unit tests were added for the `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` functionalities, primarily focusing on the new Cassandra V1 integration path. This section also uses `/* START GENAI */` comments.
    *   A `mockCassandraRepo` was implemented to facilitate testing Cassandra-related operations.
    *   `Test_GetTransaction` includes test cases for successful retrieval, handling missing user/transaction IDs, and "not found" scenarios, specifically for the Cassandra V1 path (enabled via a feature toggle).
    *   `Test_ListTransactions` covers basic valid requests and validation errors for the Cassandra V1 path.
    *   `Test_convertRequest` was added with numerous test cases to validate the conversion of `internal_v2.ListTransactionsRequest` to `transactionpb.SearchRequest`, covering various scenarios like page size limits, page tokens, account IDs, and transaction statuses (booked, pending, undefined).
    *   The tests extensively use `featuretoggle.InitFake()` and `fakeUnleash.Enable("fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2")`, confirming the focus on testing the Cassandra V1 integration.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/featuretoggle/feature_toggle.go`**

*   **Timestamp: 10/29/2025, 9:43:03 PM**
    *   A new feature toggle, `FetchV1FromCassandraForV2Toggle`, was introduced. This toggle allows for runtime control over whether the application fetches V1 transactions from Cassandra when processing V2 API requests, using the Unleash feature flagging system.
    *   The `IsEnabled()` method for this toggle incorporates the `clusterName` context for evaluation.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Feature Toggle `fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2`**: A central theme is the introduction and utilization of a feature toggle named "fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2" across all modified files. This indicates a strategic effort to migrate or enable a dual-read strategy for transaction data, allowing V2 APIs to fetch from Cassandra V1.
*   **Cassandra V1 Integration for V2 API**: The changes primarily revolve around integrating Cassandra V1 as a data source for the internal V2 transaction service, including new methods for fetching and listing, and corresponding test coverage.
*   **Cursor-Based Pagination**: The `listTransactionsFromCassandra` method explicitly implements an optimized cursor-based pagination, a common pattern for efficiently handling large datasets in distributed databases like Cassandra.
*   **`/* START GENAI */` and `/* END GENAI */` comments**: These comments consistently appear around new code blocks, particularly for the pagination cursor, Cassandra repository interface, and related tests. This suggests that these specific parts of the codebase were either generated or significantly assisted by an AI tool.
*   **Timestamp Consistency**: All changes were recorded on the same date, October 29, 2025, within a relatively short time frame, indicating a focused development or deployment activity.

## 10:53:35 AM
The provided log details changes to a Bazel `BUILD` file located at `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/api-docs/docs/BUILD`, with a timestamp of `10/30/2025, 8:59:23 AM`.

**File-Specific Updates (`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/api-docs/docs/BUILD`):**

This `BUILD` file is configured for generating, merging, and distributing API documentation, likely in OpenAPI/Swagger format, within a Go project. Key functionalities include:

*   **Go Library Definition:** It defines a `go_library` named `go_default_library` using `merge.go`. This library's purpose is to merge OpenAPI specifications, indicated by its dependencies on `@com_github_go_openapi_loads` and `@com_github_go_openapi_spec`.
*   **Swagger Aggregation (Container Layer):** A `container_layer` named "swagger" is created, which aggregates a substantial number of Swagger definition files from various gRPC services and backend components. These include:
    *   Numerous `tink-api-grpc` services (e.g., `authentication_configuration_service`, `income_checks/v2`, `risk_insights`, `merchants/v1`, `bulk_payments/v1`, `transaction_history/transactions/v2`, `golden_receiver`).
    *   Several `se_tink_backend` services (e.g., `budgets-bfm`, `cash-flow`, `financial-calendar`, `link/session/v1`, `account/account-proxy/proxy/v2`).
    *   This layer consolidates all necessary API specifications.
*   **Docker Image Creation:** A `container_image` named "image" is defined. This image:
    *   Uses `@debian-debootstrap//image` as its base.
    *   Executes `./entrypoint.sh`.
    *   Includes the `entrypoint.sh` script and the compiled Go binary from `//docs/cmd/merge` (likely the tool responsible for merging the Swagger files).
    *   Incorporates the "swagger" container layer, making all aggregated Swagger files available within the image.
*   **Docker Push Configuration:** A `container_push` rule named `docker_push` is set up to publish the created image.
    *   The image will be pushed to `784217881480.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com` with the repository `api-docs`.
    *   The tag for the image is dynamically set using `{GATEWAY_VERSION}`.
*   **Go Test Definition:** A `go_test` rule is included for `merge_test.go`, ensuring the functionality of the OpenAPI merging library is validated, including support for test data from `testdata/**`.
*   **Gazelle Integration:** `gazelle` is used, indicating that Bazel build rules for Go code are automatically generated and maintained, with the prefix `github.com/tink-ab/tink-api-gateway/docs`.

**Timestamp of Significant Change:**

The detailed changes for this `BUILD` file were recorded on `10/30/2025, 8:59:23 AM`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Bazel Build System:** The entire log revolves around Bazel, using a variety of rules (`go_library`, `go_test`, `container_image`, `container_layer`, `container_push`, `gazelle`) for managing dependencies, building Go code, and orchestrating Docker image creation and deployment.
*   **API Documentation Focus:** A strong recurring theme is the generation and consolidation of API documentation, specifically OpenAPI/Swagger specifications, from a multitude of internal services.
*   **Microservice Architecture:** The extensive list of `_swagger` files from various Tink API gRPC services and backend components (`com_tink_api_grpc`, `se_tink_backend`) indicates a microservice-oriented architecture where API specifications are generated per service and then aggregated.
*   **Containerization:** Docker is central to the deployment strategy, with Bazel building a custom `api-docs` image that includes the documentation and tools for processing it, ready for pushing to AWS ECR.
*   **Automated Tooling:** The presence of `gazelle` and the `merge.go` utility suggests an emphasis on automated processes for code generation, dependency management, and API documentation handling.

## 9:39:49 PM

## 9:40:08 PM
The provided log details recent updates across three Go source files within a transaction service, primarily focusing on a new data retrieval strategy and its testing, heavily leveraging feature toggles and cursor-based pagination.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go` (Changed at 10/29/2025, 9:04:34 PM and 10/29/2025, 9:04:54 PM):**
    The core `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl` now supports fetching transactions from two different data sources: Cassandra (v1) or Elasticsearch, determined by a `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag.
    Significant additions, explicitly marked with `/* START GENAI */` comments, include:
    *   A `PaginationCursor` struct for cursor-based pagination across Cassandra periods.
    *   A `cassandraRepository` interface defining methods for Cassandra operations, specifically `GetTransactionsByUserIDAndIDsWithPeriods` and `FindByUserIDAndPeriodWithCursor`.
    *   New methods `getTransactionFromCassandra` and `listTransactionsFromCassandra` were introduced to handle Cassandra data retrieval. The `listTransactionsFromCassandra` includes detailed internal documentation outlining an optimized cursor-based pagination flow.
    *   The `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` gRPC endpoint implementations were updated to act as dispatchers, routing requests to either the Cassandra or Elasticsearch backend based on the `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag. The second timestamp likely represents the completion of the `ListTransactions` dispatcher function, which was truncated in the first log entry.

*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server_test.go` (Changed at 10/29/2025, 9:32:11 PM):**
    This file introduces comprehensive unit tests for the new Cassandra data retrieval logic.
    *   A `mockCassandraRepo` was added (also marked with `/* START GENAI */` comments) to simulate Cassandra interactions for `GetTransactionsByUserIDAndIDsWithPeriods` and `FindByUserIDAndPeriodWithCursor`.
    *   `Test_GetTransaction` now includes scenarios for fetching a single transaction from the mocked Cassandra, covering valid requests, missing user/transaction IDs, and "not found" cases.
    *   `Test_ListTransactions` includes tests for listing transactions from the mocked Cassandra, including valid requests and validation errors.
    *   Both test functions enable the `fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2` feature toggle, confirming the tests specifically target the Cassandra path.
    *   The `Test_convertRequest` function was also updated, providing extensive test cases for transforming internal v2 list transaction requests into transaction search requests, handling various filtering and pagination parameters.

*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/featuretoggle/feature_toggle.go` (Changed at 10/29/2025, 9:43:03 PM):**
    This file was updated to define and manage a new feature toggle: `FetchV1FromCassandraForV2Toggle`.
    *   The `fetchV1FromCassandraForV2Toggle` struct and its `IsEnabled()` method were added, which uses the Unleash client to check the status of the "fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2" feature. This toggle is critical for controlling the dual data source strategy implemented in `internal_server.go`.
    *   The `Init()` and `InitFake()` functions manage the initialization of the Unleash client, allowing for both production-like and test environments.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The changes occurred on October 29, 2025.
*   Two very close updates to `internal_server.go` (9:04:34 PM and 9:04:54 PM) indicate rapid adjustments or completion of a single task related to the server's core logic.
*   The update to `internal_server_test.go` followed shortly after (9:32:11 PM), demonstrating that testing for the new feature was integrated concurrently or immediately after the core logic.
*   The `feature_toggle.go` update (9:43:03 PM) shows the explicit definition of the feature flag that orchestrates the behavior, aligning with the implementation and testing.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **`/* START GENAI */` / `/* END GENAI */` Comments:** These comments are a prominent pattern, surrounding new structs, interfaces, and core functions in `internal_server.go` and mock implementations/tests in `internal_server_test.go`. This suggests that the changes are part of a specific initiative, possibly related to Generative AI tooling, a major feature release, or a designated project.
*   **Feature Toggle-Driven Development:** The entire workflow for fetching transactions from Cassandra v1 for the v2 internal API is controlled by a dedicated feature toggle (`fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2`). This allows for phased rollouts, A/B testing, or dynamic switching between data sources.
*   **Dual Data Source Strategy:** The `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl` employs a clear pattern of supporting two distinct data retrieval paths (Cassandra and Elasticsearch) for its `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` operations, enabling flexibility and potentially a migration strategy.
*   **Cursor-Based Pagination:** For the Cassandra implementation, there's a clear focus on cursor-based pagination, designed for efficient fetching across multiple time periods.
*   **Comprehensive Unit Testing:** The test file demonstrates a commitment to robust testing, utilizing mocks and table-driven tests to cover various scenarios and ensure the reliability of the new data retrieval and request conversion logic.
