# Activity Summary for 10/30/2025

## 8:38:24 AM
The changes primarily focus on implementing and testing a dual-read strategy for transaction data, shifting from Elasticsearch to Cassandra v1 for internal v2 API calls, managed via a feature toggle and leveraging cursor-based pagination for Cassandra.

In `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go`, significant architectural changes were introduced around 10/29/2025, 9:04:34 PM. A `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag was added to the `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl` to conditionally route requests. The `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` methods now check this flag to decide between fetching data from Cassandra or Elasticsearch. New `getTransactionFromCassandra` and `listTransactionsFromCassandra` functions were implemented. The Cassandra-based list function (`listTransactionsFromCassandra`) incorporates a cursor-based pagination strategy, including a `PaginationCursor` struct for tracking `LastPeriod` and `LastTransactionID`, and a `cassandraRepository` interface defining methods for fetching transactions by IDs and by period with a cursor. This function handles parsing cursors, calculating periods, fetching data, applying filters, sorting, and converting Cassandra v1 transactions to the v2 internal format. A subsequent change at 10/29/2025, 9:04:54 PM completed the `ListTransactions` method, explicitly assigning the conditional routing to either `listTransactionsFromCassandra` or `listTransactionsFromElasticsearch`.

The file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server_test.go` was updated around 10/29/2025, 9:32:11 PM to include a `mockCassandraRepo` for testing the new Cassandra data access layer. `Test_GetTransaction` and `Test_ListTransactions` were added to validate the Cassandra-backed transaction fetching. These tests specifically enable the `"fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2"` feature toggle to ensure the Cassandra path is exercised. They cover scenarios like valid requests, missing user/transaction IDs, and "not found" cases, using mocked Cassandra responses.

Concurrently, at 10/29/2025, 9:43:03 PM, the file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/featuretoggle/feature_toggle.go` was modified to introduce a new feature toggle, `FetchV1FromCassandraForV2Toggle`. This toggle provides the `IsEnabled()` method, which queries the Unleash feature flag system for `"fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2"`, directly controlling the behavior of the `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag in the `internal_server.go` service.

A recurring pattern is the use of `/* START GENAI */` and `/* END GENAI */` comments, which surround newly introduced structures and functions related to Cassandra integration and pagination in both the core service and its tests, suggesting the use of a Generative AI tool in their development. The overarching theme is a strategic migration or dual-read capability to fetch transaction data from Cassandra v1 to serve internal v2 APIs, carefully controlled by feature flags and implemented with advanced pagination techniques.

## 9:38:29 AM
The log details a series of concentrated changes focused on enhancing transaction retrieval and listing capabilities, primarily by introducing and integrating Cassandra as a data source alongside an existing Elasticsearch solution, controlled by a feature toggle.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go (10/29/2025, 9:04:34 PM & 9:04:54 PM):**
    *   Introduced `PaginationCursor` and `cassandraRepository` interface, defining methods for fetching transactions by IDs and by user/period with a cursor.
    *   The `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl` now conditionally serves `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` requests from either Cassandra or Elasticsearch, based on the `readCassandraV1AsV2` feature flag.
    *   A new `listTransactionsFromCassandra` function implements complex cursor-based pagination logic, including parsing cursors, calculating periods, fetching transactions by period, filtering, sorting, and encoding the next page token. This indicates a significant architectural change for data retrieval.
    *   The two timestamps for this file show very similar content, with the second likely being a minor update or re-commit of the first, possibly completing a truncated section from the prior log entry, without introducing new functional changes.

*   **/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server_test.go (10/29/2025, 9:32:11 PM):**
    *   A `mockCassandraRepo` was added, providing mock implementations for `GetTransactionsByUserIDAndIDsWithPeriodsFn` and `FindByUserIDAndPeriodWithCursorFn`, which are crucial for testing the new Cassandra integration.
    *   New unit tests were added for the `GetTransaction` method, covering successful requests, validation failures (missing user/transaction IDs), and scenarios where a transaction is not found. These tests explicitly enable the `fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2` feature toggle to test the Cassandra-backed logic.
    *   Additional test structures for `ListTransactions` and `convertRequest` are present, demonstrating validation and request transformation for the broader transaction service.

*   **/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/featuretoggle/feature_toggle.go (10/29/2025, 9:43:03 PM):**
    *   A new feature toggle, `FetchV1FromCassandraForV2Toggle`, was implemented. Its `IsEnabled()` method checks the state of the "fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2" feature flag, which is used to control whether transaction data is read from Cassandra or Elasticsearch.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The changes occurred within a concentrated period on October 29, 2025, starting at 9:04:34 PM with the core Cassandra integration logic, followed by the addition of comprehensive tests at 9:32:11 PM, and the definition of the controlling feature toggle at 9:43:03 PM.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Cassandra Integration and Migration:** A dominant theme is the introduction and integration of Cassandra as a primary data source for internal transaction services. This includes specific interfaces (`cassandraRepository`), data conversion logic (`FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal`), and the ability to switch between Cassandra and Elasticsearch. This suggests an ongoing data source migration or a dual-read strategy.
*   **Feature Toggling:** The widespread use of an `Unleash` feature toggling system (`fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2`) allows for controlled rollout or A/B testing of the Cassandra-backed transaction retrieval. This pattern ensures flexibility and reduced risk in deploying new data sources.
*   **Cursor-Based Pagination:** The detailed implementation of cursor-based pagination for `ListTransactions` from Cassandra indicates a focus on efficient and scalable data retrieval for large datasets.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** The addition of mock repositories and thorough unit tests for the new features demonstrates a commitment to robust and reliable code, testing the new Cassandra path under various conditions.
*   **gRPC Service Enhancement:** The modifications are all within a gRPC service context, extending its capabilities for internal transaction management.
*   **Observability:** The consistent use of `tracer.StartSpanFromContext` indicates an adherence to distributed tracing for monitoring and debugging performance in the updated services.

## 9:53:37 AM
The primary change recorded occurred on `10/30/2025, 8:59:23 AM`, targeting the `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/api-docs/docs/BUILD` file.

This change to the Bazel `BUILD` file indicates a significant update to how API documentation (specifically Swagger/OpenAPI definitions) is compiled and deployed. The file defines rules for Go libraries and tests, and crucially, for Docker container images.

**Key updates in `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/api-docs/docs/BUILD`:**

*   **Expanded API Documentation Inclusion:** The `container_layer` named `swagger` has been substantially updated. It now includes a considerably larger set of Swagger definition files from various Tink services and backend components. This expansion covers a broad range of functionalities, including:
    *   `authentication_configuration_service`
    *   `tink/income_checks/v2`
    *   `tink/risk_insights`
    *   `tink/expense_checks/v1`
    *   `tink/merchants/v1`
    *   `tink/settlement_accounts/v1`
    *   `tink/settlement_account_payment_requests/v1`
    *   `tink/bulk_payments/v1`
    *   `tink/transaction_history/transactions/v2`
    *   `tink/transaction_history/reports/v2`
    *   `tink/golden_receiver`
    *   `se_tink_backend//src/budgets-bfm/api`
    *   `se_tink_backend//src/cash-flow/api/proto`
    *   `se_tink_backend//src/financial-calendar/api/proto`
    *   `se_tink_backend//src/link/proto/session/v1`
    *   `se_tink_backend//src/account/account-proxy/proxy/proto/v2`
    This comprehensive addition suggests a major effort to consolidate or update the API documentation for a wide array of services, potentially indicating new service releases or a push for more centralized and complete API specifications.
*   **Container Image Configuration:** A `container_image` named `image` is defined, built upon a Debian base, and includes an `entrypoint.sh` script, a merge utility, and integrates the newly expanded `swagger` layer.
*   **Docker Push Configuration:** A `container_push` rule named `docker_push` is set up to push this `image` to an AWS ECR registry (`784217881480.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/api-docs`) with a tag determined by `{GATEWAY_VERSION}`. This confirms the deployment target for the generated API documentation image.
*   **Go Library and Test Definitions:** The file also maintains definitions for a `go_library` (`merge.go`) responsible for documentation merging and a `go_test` (`merge_test.go`), indicating ongoing development and testing of the documentation generation process itself.

**Pattern:** The extensive list of `swagger` definitions and their frequent updates suggest a recurring pattern of integrating and consolidating API documentation as new services are developed or existing ones are updated within the Tink ecosystem. This `BUILD` file serves as a central point for orchestrating the inclusion of these definitions into a deployable API documentation image.
