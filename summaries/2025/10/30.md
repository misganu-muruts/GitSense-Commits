# Activity Summary for 10/30/2025

## 8:38:24 AM
The changes primarily focus on implementing and testing a dual-read strategy for transaction data, shifting from Elasticsearch to Cassandra v1 for internal v2 API calls, managed via a feature toggle and leveraging cursor-based pagination for Cassandra.

In `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go`, significant architectural changes were introduced around 10/29/2025, 9:04:34 PM. A `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag was added to the `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl` to conditionally route requests. The `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` methods now check this flag to decide between fetching data from Cassandra or Elasticsearch. New `getTransactionFromCassandra` and `listTransactionsFromCassandra` functions were implemented. The Cassandra-based list function (`listTransactionsFromCassandra`) incorporates a cursor-based pagination strategy, including a `PaginationCursor` struct for tracking `LastPeriod` and `LastTransactionID`, and a `cassandraRepository` interface defining methods for fetching transactions by IDs and by period with a cursor. This function handles parsing cursors, calculating periods, fetching data, applying filters, sorting, and converting Cassandra v1 transactions to the v2 internal format. A subsequent change at 10/29/2025, 9:04:54 PM completed the `ListTransactions` method, explicitly assigning the conditional routing to either `listTransactionsFromCassandra` or `listTransactionsFromElasticsearch`.

The file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server_test.go` was updated around 10/29/2025, 9:32:11 PM to include a `mockCassandraRepo` for testing the new Cassandra data access layer. `Test_GetTransaction` and `Test_ListTransactions` were added to validate the Cassandra-backed transaction fetching. These tests specifically enable the `"fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2"` feature toggle to ensure the Cassandra path is exercised. They cover scenarios like valid requests, missing user/transaction IDs, and "not found" cases, using mocked Cassandra responses.

Concurrently, at 10/29/2025, 9:43:03 PM, the file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/featuretoggle/feature_toggle.go` was modified to introduce a new feature toggle, `FetchV1FromCassandraForV2Toggle`. This toggle provides the `IsEnabled()` method, which queries the Unleash feature flag system for `"fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2"`, directly controlling the behavior of the `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag in the `internal_server.go` service.

A recurring pattern is the use of `/* START GENAI */` and `/* END GENAI */` comments, which surround newly introduced structures and functions related to Cassandra integration and pagination in both the core service and its tests, suggesting the use of a Generative AI tool in their development. The overarching theme is a strategic migration or dual-read capability to fetch transaction data from Cassandra v1 to serve internal v2 APIs, carefully controlled by feature flags and implemented with advanced pagination techniques.
