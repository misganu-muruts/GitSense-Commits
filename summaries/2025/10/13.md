# Activity Summary for 10/13/2025

On October 13, 2025, at 11:57:38 AM, changes were made to the `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/commands/es_service_cmd/esservice.go` file.

This file defines the `serveWithESCmd` Cobra command, which serves as the main entry point for running the `transaction-service` gRPC server. The update details the comprehensive setup and orchestration of various microservice components and integrations.

Key updates and functionalities include:

*   **Core Server Setup:** Initializes and configures a gRPC server that handles both external (`TransactionStoreServer`) and internal (`InternalTransactionsServiceServer`) transaction services. It includes configurations for maximum message size, TLS (certificate and private key paths), gRPC recovery middleware, and health checks.
*   **Extensive Integrations:** The service integrates with a wide array of dependencies:
    *   **Search and Storage:** Utilizes Elasticsearch/OpenSearch through a `CompositeSearchClient` for transaction search and an `ISMClient` for managing index policies, specifically creating temporary user index policies based on a feature toggle.
    *   **Caching:** Incorporates a Redis client for search result caching, configurable with TTL and host lists.
    *   **Messaging:** Sets up a Kafka deletion listener (`StartDeletionConsumer`) to process deletion requests from a Kafka topic. This listener interacts with OpenSearch and Cassandra, and includes a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) producer for failed messages. The listener's activation is conditional on a `run-id` flag.
    *   **Cloud Services:** Connects to AWS SNS for transaction mutation events and AWS Secret Manager for secure credential retrieval.
    *   **Databases:** Manages transactions in Cassandra (`Repository`) and includes support for both primary and a V2 Cassandra setup.
    *   **Internal Services:** Depends on `UserRepo` and `AccountService` clients for user and account-related operations.
*   **Data Retention Service:** Introduces a `DataRetentionService` (enabled by a feature flag) with extensive configuration options for managing data lifecycle, including database connections (main DB, Cassandra V1 & V2), queue names, and secret management integration.
*   **Observability & Feature Toggles:** Integrates Datadog for distributed tracing and uses a `featuretoggle` system for dynamic feature enablement (e.g., `TempUserIndexToggle`).
*   **Configuration Management:** Relies heavily on a `utils` package (`utils.GetString`, `utils.GetInt`, `utils.GetBool`) to retrieve configuration values from command-line flags, covering aspects like logging level, service addresses, TLS settings, Kafka brokers, Redis hosts, and database credentials.
*   **Graceful Shutdown:** Implements a mechanism to handle termination signals (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, `SIGHUP`) for a graceful server shutdown.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Centralized Configuration:** A strong pattern of utilizing command-line flags for all configurable parameters, retrieved via helper functions in a `utils` package.
*   **Conditional Service Initialization:** Many services (Redis, Kafka listener, SNS, Secret Manager, Data Retention) are initialized only if their corresponding enablement flags are set to true, promoting a modular and configurable architecture.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Consistent use of `slog` for structured logging and `os.Exit(1)` for critical initialization failures.
*   **Modular Architecture:** The code demonstrates a microservice architecture with clear separation of concerns, reflected in the numerous distinct client and service integrations.
*   **Common Prefix:** The `github.com/tink-ab/transaction-service` path is a recurring prefix for internal module imports.
