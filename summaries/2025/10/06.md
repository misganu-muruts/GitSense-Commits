# Activity Summary for 10/6/2025

## 11:18:03 AM
The log details changes exclusively for the file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/golden-receiver/service/logic.go`.

**File-Specific Updates:**
Despite three separate log entries with different timestamps, the content of `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/golden-receiver/service/logic.go` remains **unchanged** across all entries. The file consistently contains the implementation of core business logic for the `golden-receiver` service.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The file was logged at `10/6/2025, 11:00:59 AM`, `10/6/2025, 11:02:20 AM`, and `10/6/2025, 11:02:34 AM`. These timestamps indicate distinct points at which the file's state was recorded, but no modifications to the code content were introduced between these records.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The code defines several Go functions within the `service` package, primarily handling user and account related operations:
*   `fetchInfoForExternalUserId`: Retrieves user and account information, handling cases where users or accounts are not found, and logging debug/error messages.
*   `getCurrencyCode`: Extracts currency code from an account or defaults to a user's currency.
*   `getUserInfo`: Fetches detailed user information, including currency, flags, locale, and market, from a `userServiceClient`.
*   `updateOperation`, `addErrToOperation`, `getReasonsFromValidationError`: These functions are concerned with managing and reporting validation errors and exceptions related to transactions and operations within a `goldenreceiverpb.GetOperationResponse` protobuf structure, indicating robust error reporting for processing data.
*   `getIngestionType`: Determines the type of data ingestion (FullIngestion or PartialIngestion) by inspecting gRPC metadata headers (`batch-failure-type`), defaulting to `FullIngestion` if metadata is missing or unmatchable.

Common patterns include:
*   Extensive use of `context.Context` for request-scoped values and cancellation.
*   Interactions with gRPC services (e.g., `accountServiceClient`, `userService`) and handling gRPC-specific errors (`google.golang.org/grpc/codes`, `google.golang.org/grpc/status`, `google.golang.org/grpc/metadata`).
*   Dependency on internal packages like `golden-receiver/internal/go_sns` and `golden-receiver/internal/user`.
*   Frequent logging (`srv.log.Debug`, `srv.log.Error`, `srv.log.Warn`) for operational insights and debugging.
*   Structured error handling using `github.com/pkg/errors` for wrapping errors and checking specific error types (e.g., `user.NotFoundError`).
*   Manipulation of Google Protobuf `wrapperspb.StringValue` for optional string fields.
