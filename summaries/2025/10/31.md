# Activity Summary for 10/31/2025

## 8:09:18 AM

The provided log details changes to a single Bazel `BUILD` file, specifically located at `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/api-docs/docs/BUILD`. This file, last updated on 10/30/2025 at 8:59:23 AM, is responsible for building, testing, and deploying API documentation for the Tink project.

Key information from this change includes:

*   **Bazel Build Configuration:** The file heavily leverages Bazel rules for Go (`go_library`, `go_test`) and Docker (`container_layer`, `container_image`, `container_push`). It defines a Go library from `merge.go` and a corresponding test file, likely for processing or merging API specifications.
*   **API Documentation Aggregation:** A central feature is the `container_layer` named `swagger`. This layer explicitly bundles a large number of Swagger/OpenAPI definition files (`.swagger` or `_fixed_swagger`) from various gRPC services and backend components. This indicates a robust system for collecting and consolidating API documentation from disparate services within the Tink ecosystem. Recurring patterns like `@com_tink_api_grpc//...` and `@se_tink_backend//...` point to automated generation and inclusion of these specifications.
*   **Docker Image Creation:** An `api-docs` Docker image is configured (`container_image` name `image`). This image is based on `debian-debootstrap`, uses an `entrypoint.sh` script, includes a compiled `merge` command, and crucially, incorporates the `swagger` layer containing all the aggregated API definitions. This suggests the merged documentation is intended to be served via this Docker container.
*   **Deployment to AWS ECR:** The `container_push` rule specifies deployment of the `api-docs` image to an AWS ECR registry (`784217881480.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/api-docs`), tagged with `{GATEWAY_VERSION}`. This indicates an automated pipeline for publishing the compiled API documentation.

In summary, this change represents an update to the CI/CD pipeline for Tink's API documentation, focusing on automatically gathering numerous Swagger definitions from various services, merging them, packaging them into a Docker image, and pushing this image to AWS ECR for deployment, presumably to serve as a central API reference.

*   **Dependency Management:** Highlighted use of Bazel with Gazelle for Go modules.

In summary, the log entries indicate monitoring or repetitive saving of the `README.md` file, which serves as a central hub for development information, setup instructions, and best practices within the `tink-backend` project.

## 8:25:22 AM
The changes primarily introduce and integrate a new data source, Cassandra V1, into the existing transaction service's internal gRPC API, specifically for transaction retrieval operations. This integration is controlled by a feature flag.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go (10/29/2025, 9:04:34 PM and 9:04:54 PM):**
    *   **New Cassandra V1 Read Path:** Significant additions to handle fetching and listing transactions directly from Cassandra V1.
    *   **Feature Flag Control:** The `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` gRPC methods now check a `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag (presumably controlled by a feature toggle) to route requests to either new Cassandra-backed implementations (`getTransactionFromCassandra`, `listTransactionsFromCassandra`) or existing Elasticsearch-backed ones (`getTransactionFromElasticsearch`, `listTransactionsFromElasticsearch`).
    *   **Cursor-Based Pagination:** A new `PaginationCursor` struct and supporting logic (`decodeCursor`, `encodeCursor`, `calculatePeriodsFromDateRange`, `fetchTransactionsWithCursor`) have been introduced for efficient cursor-based pagination when querying Cassandra.
    *   **Cassandra Repository Interface:** A `cassandraRepository` interface with methods like `GetTransactionsByUserIDAndIDsWithPeriods` and `FindByUserIDAndPeriodWithCursor` is defined, abstracting Cassandra interactions.
    *   **Data Conversion:** Logic for converting Cassandra V1 transaction formats to V2 internal formats (`cassandra.FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal`) is included.
    *   **Tracing and Error Handling:** Datadog tracing spans are added, and robust error handling is implemented for various failure scenarios (e.g., missing user/transaction IDs, transaction not found).
    *   The second timestamp for this file (9:04:54 PM) appears to be a minor completion or correction of the `ListTransactions` function body, which was truncated in the previous entry, making the code fully functional as intended.

*   **/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server_test.go (10/29/2025, 9:32:11 PM):**
    *   **Mock Cassandra Repository:** A `mockCassandraRepo` is introduced to simulate Cassandra database behavior for testing purposes, implementing the `cassandraRepository` interface.
    *   **Extensive New Tests:** New test suites, `Test_GetTransaction` and `Test_ListTransactions`, are added to cover the Cassandra-backed transaction retrieval logic.
    *   **Feature Toggle Testing:** These tests explicitly enable the `fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2` feature toggle using `featuretoggle.InitFake()` to ensure the Cassandra read path is exercised.
    *   **Test Cases:** Tests cover successful retrieval, validation errors (missing user/transaction IDs), and "not found" scenarios for both single transaction retrieval and listing operations.

*   **/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/featuretoggle/feature_toggle.go (10/29/2025, 9:43:03 PM):**
    *   **New Feature Flag Definition:** A new feature toggle, `FetchV1FromCassandraForV2Toggle`, is added. Its `IsEnabled()` method checks the "fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2" flag in the Unleash feature toggle system, using the `clusterName` context. This formally introduces the control mechanism for the Cassandra V1 read path.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Feature Flag-Driven Migration/Dual-Read:** A consistent pattern across the codebase is the use of the "fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2" feature toggle. This strongly indicates a strategy to either migrate from Elasticsearch to Cassandra V1 for certain transaction data or to enable a dual-read capability for the internal V2 API, allowing controlled rollout and testing.
*   **"GENAI" Markers:** The `/* START GENAI */` and `/* END GENAI */` comments appear consistently in `internal_server.go` and `internal_server_test.go`, marking significant blocks of newly added or modified code related to this initiative.
*   **Architectural Segregation:** The service is designed to separate concerns by delegating to specific functions (`getTransactionFromCassandra`/`getTransactionFromElasticsearch`, etc.) based on the feature flag, maintaining a clean entry point for gRPC requests.
*   **Emphasis on Pagination:** The detailed implementation of cursor-based pagination for Cassandra suggests an expectation of large datasets and a focus on performance and scalability for transaction listings.
*   **Traceability and Observability:** The integration of Datadog tracing (`tracer.StartSpanFromContext`) points to an emphasis on monitoring and understanding the performance characteristics of the new Cassandra data path.

## 9:09:17 AM
The provided log details changes to a single Bazel `BUILD` file, located at `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/api-docs/docs/BUILD`, with a timestamp of **10/30/2025, 8:59:23 AM**.

**File-Specific Updates for `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/api-docs/docs/BUILD`:**

The `BUILD` file orchestrates the generation and deployment of API documentation. Key updates and configurations include:

*   **Bazel Rule Loading:** It loads various Bazel rules for Go (`go_library`, `go_test`), Gazelle (`gazelle`), and Docker (`go_image`, `container_run_and_commit`, `container_image`, `container_layer`, `container_push`).
*   **Go Library and Testing:**
    *   A `go_library` named `go_default_library` is defined, using `merge.go` as its source, indicating a Go application responsible for merging API specifications. It depends on `go_openapi_loads` and `go_openapi_spec`.
    *   A corresponding `go_test` named `go_default_test` is set up for `merge_test.go`, including test data and using `stretchr_testify/assert`.
*   **Swagger/OpenAPI Aggregation (`container_layer`):**
    *   A significant `container_layer` named `swagger` is defined. This layer aggregates a substantial number of Swagger/OpenAPI definition files from various gRPC services and backend modules.
    *   These definitions originate from `@com_tink_api_grpc` (e.g., `authentication_configuration_service`, `tink/income_checks/v2`, `tink/risk_insights`, `tink/expense_checks/v1`, `tink/merchants/v1`, `tink/settlement_accounts/v1`, `tink/bulk_payments/v1`, `tink/golden_receiver`, `tink/transaction_history`) and `@se_tink_backend` (e.g., `budgets-bfm/api`, `cash-flow/api/proto`, `financial-calendar/api/proto`, `link/proto/session/v1`, `account/account-proxy/proxy/proto/v2`).
    *   This indicates a centralized process for collecting API documentation from a wide array of microservices and backend components.
*   **Docker Image Creation and Push:**
    *   A `container_image` named `image` is built using a Debian base (`@debian-debootstrap//image`). It includes an `entrypoint.sh` script and the compiled Go binary from `//docs/cmd/merge`, and critically incorporates the `:swagger` layer.
    *   A `container_push` rule named `docker_push` is configured to push this image to an AWS ECR registry (`784217881480.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`) under the `api-docs` repository, tagged with a `{GATEWAY_VERSION}` placeholder.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The most prominent pattern is the extensive list of individual Swagger/OpenAPI definitions being compiled into a single `swagger` container layer. This clearly suggests an architecture where numerous microservices contribute their API specifications, which are then collected and potentially merged or packaged together for an API Gateway or consolidated documentation portal. The naming conventions (e.g., `_swagger`, `_fixed_swagger`) are consistent across various services, indicating a standardized approach to API definition generation within the organization.

## 9:25:08 AM
The log exclusively tracks changes to the file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/tink-backend/README.md`.

    *   Checklist for new Go projects, including listing in `gazelle-external`, adding Docker Bazel build rules, and registering with `catalog-info.yaml`.
    *   Bazel with Gazelle supporting Go modules for dependency management.

In summary, the `README.md` is a critical, highly detailed guide for onboarding and developing within the Tink backend ecosystem, heavily relying on Bazel for build, test, and run processes, and minikube for local infrastructure.

## 9:25:19 AM
The provided log details a series of closely related code changes focused on enabling transaction retrieval and listing from Cassandra (specifically, "v1" data) within a gRPC service, controlled by a new feature toggle. This work involves a shift from or an alternative to an existing Elasticsearch-based transaction search.

**Key Information by File:**

*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/29/2025, 9:04:34 PM** (with a minor follow-up entry at 9:04:54 PM, likely a re-save).
    *   This file introduces the core logic for interacting with Cassandra for transaction data.
    *   New structures and interfaces like `PaginationCursor` and `cassandraRepository` are defined, supporting cursor-based pagination and Cassandra operations.
    *   The `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl` is updated to include a `cassandraRepo` dependency and a `readCassandraV1AsV2` boolean flag, which dictates whether to read from Cassandra or Elasticsearch.
    *   The `GetTransaction` method is modified to conditionally call `getTransactionFromCassandra` or `getTransactionFromElasticsearch` based on the `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag.
    *   A new `getTransactionFromCassandra` function is implemented to fetch transactions by ID from Cassandra, convert them from a v1 Cassandra format to a v2 internal format, and enrich them with account currency information.
    *   A comprehensive `listTransactionsFromCassandra` method is added to handle listing transactions from Cassandra using an optimized cursor-based pagination strategy. This includes parsing cursors, calculating periods, fetching data with a cursor, filtering, sorting, and encoding the next page token.
    *   The main `ListTransactions` method is updated to also use the `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag to route requests to either `listTransactionsFromCassandra` or `listTransactionsFromElasticsearch`.

*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server_test.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/29/2025, 9:32:11 PM**
    *   This file introduces new test infrastructure to validate the Cassandra integration.
    *   A `mockCassandraRepo` is implemented to simulate Cassandra interactions for testing purposes.
    *   New test functions, `Test_GetTransaction` and `Test_ListTransactions`, are added to cover the Cassandra paths. These tests enable the `fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2` feature toggle (mentioned below) to ensure the Cassandra logic is exercised.
    *   Tests verify successful transaction retrieval, handle missing user/transaction IDs, and check for "not found" scenarios.

*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/featuretoggle/feature_toggle.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/29/2025, 9:43:03 PM**
    *   This file adds a new feature toggle named `FetchV1FromCassandraForV2Toggle`.
    *   It includes the `IsEnabled()` method for this toggle, which checks the status of the `fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2` flag using the Unleash client. This allows for dynamic control over whether the Cassandra-based transaction fetching/listing is active.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Feature Toggle-Driven Migration:** The entire set of changes is orchestrated around a new feature toggle, `"fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2"`. This toggle allows for a controlled rollout or A/B testing of the new Cassandra-based transaction retrieval logic versus the existing Elasticsearch-based approach.
*   **Cassandra V1 to V2 Internal Conversion:** There's a clear emphasis on reading "Cassandra v1" transactions and converting them into a "v2 internal format" (`cassandra.FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal`), suggesting an underlying data model evolution or standardization.
*   **Cursor-Based Pagination:** The `listTransactionsFromCassandra` implementation leverages cursor-based pagination, indicating a design choice for efficient handling of large datasets and continuous fetching, particularly relevant for a time-series database like Cassandra.

*   **Go language emphasis:** A dedicated section on "Programming with Go" and its interaction with Bazel implies Go is a significant language used in this backend project.

## 10:25:20 AM
The primary theme across these changes is the integration of Cassandra as an alternative data source for fetching transactions, specifically for an internal v2 API, alongside an existing Elasticsearch-based approach. This integration is managed by a feature toggle.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go`**
*   **10/29/2025, 9:04:34 PM**: This entry introduces new functionality for handling transactions via Cassandra. It defines a `PaginationCursor` struct and a `cassandraRepository` interface, both explicitly marked with `/* START GENAI */` comments, suggesting an AI-assisted development. The `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl` struct is updated to include a `cassandraRepo` and a `readCassandraV1AsV2` boolean flag. The `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` gRPC methods are refactored to conditionally delegate to either Cassandra-specific (`getTransactionFromCassandra`, `listTransactionsFromCassandra`) or Elasticsearch-specific (`getTransactionFromElasticsearch`, `listTransactionsFromElasticsearch`) implementations based on the `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag. The `getTransactionFromCassandra` method is fully implemented, while `listTransactionsFromCassandra` is partially defined, outlining the logic for cursor-based pagination across Cassandra periods.
*   **10/29/2025, 9:04:54 PM**: A subsequent change to the same file completes the top-level `ListTransactions` method, ensuring it correctly dispatches requests to either the `listTransactionsFromCassandra` or `listTransactionsFromElasticsearch` implementation based on the `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag. This indicates the initial implementation of the `ListTransactions` decision logic was finalized.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server_test.go`**
*   **10/29/2025, 9:32:11 PM**: This file introduces comprehensive tests for the new Cassandra integration. A `mockCassandraRepo` is implemented to simulate Cassandra behavior, allowing isolated testing. New test functions, `Test_GetTransaction` and `Test_ListTransactions`, are added. These tests explicitly enable the `fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2` feature flag, ensuring the Cassandra data path is exercised. Test cases cover successful transaction retrieval, handling missing user/transaction IDs, and scenarios where transactions are not found in Cassandra. An existing `Test_convertRequest` function for Elasticsearch-related request conversion is also present.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/featuretoggle/feature_toggle.go`**
*   **10/29/2025, 9:43:03 PM**: A new feature toggle, `FetchV1FromCassandraForV2Toggle`, is added. Its `IsEnabled()` method is designed to check the `fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2` flag, which directly controls the `readCassandraV1AsV2` boolean in `internal_server.go` and is enabled in the test cases. This signifies the introduction of a controlled rollout mechanism for the Cassandra V1 integration.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Dual Data Source Strategy**: A consistent pattern is the implementation of a dual data source strategy for transaction retrieval, offering both Elasticsearch and Cassandra paths.
*   **Feature Toggle Control**: The `fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2` feature toggle is central to these changes, acting as the mechanism to switch between the Elasticsearch and Cassandra implementations. Its introduction and usage are evident across all modified files.
*   **AI-Generated Comments**: The presence of `/* START GENAI */` and `/* END GENAI */` comments in `internal_server.go` indicates that parts of the new Cassandra integration, specifically the `PaginationCursor` and `cassandraRepository` interface, were either generated or scaffolded using an AI tool.
*   **Rapid Development**: The timestamps show a concentrated period of development, with all changes occurring within approximately an hour on the same date, suggesting focused work on integrating and testing this new Cassandra feature.

## 11:09:19 AM
The log details changes to a Bazel build file, `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/api-docs/docs/BUILD`, updated on October 30, 2025, at 8:59:23 AM.

This `BUILD` file focuses on the aggregation, processing, and packaging of OpenAPI/Swagger API documentation.

Key information from the changes includes:

*   **Go Library for OpenAPI Merging:** A Go library named `go_default_library` is defined, built from `merge.go`. Its dependencies on `@com_github_go_openapi_loads` and `@com_github_go_openapi_spec` suggest its role is to load and manipulate OpenAPI specifications.
*   **Extensive Swagger Aggregation:** A significant `container_layer` named `swagger` is configured to include a large collection of Swagger definition files. These files originate from various Tink gRPC services and backend components, such as `authentication_configuration_service`, `income_checks`, `risk_insights`, `merchants`, `settlement_accounts`, `bulk_payments`, `transaction_history`, `golden_receiver`, `budgets-bfm`, `cash-flow`, `financial-calendar`, `link/session`, and `account/account-proxy`. This indicates a centralized effort to collect API documentation from disparate services.
*   **Docker Image for API Docs:** A `container_image` named `image` is defined, using a Debian base. It includes an `entrypoint.sh` script, a compiled `merge` command (likely from the Go library), and the aforementioned `swagger` layer. This implies the image is designed to serve or process the aggregated API documentation.
*   **AWS ECR Deployment:** A `container_push` rule is configured to push this `api-docs` Docker image to an AWS ECR registry (`784217881480.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/api-docs`), with the tag dynamically set by `{GATEWAY_VERSION}`.
*   **Testing:** Corresponding `go_test` definitions are present for `merge.go`, including `testdata`, indicating a robust development process for the documentation merging logic.

The overarching pattern is the use of Bazel to automate the collection, processing (via a Go application), and deployment of a comprehensive set of OpenAPI/Swagger definitions for the Tink API Gateway, consolidating documentation from numerous internal services into a single deployable Docker image.

## 11:25:14 AM
The changes log primarily involves two files within the `tink-backend` project:

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/tink-backend/README.md`**
Across multiple timestamps on October 30, 2025 (specifically from 8:41:56 AM to 8:52:56 AM), the content of this `README.md` file remained unchanged. The log entries indicate repeated saving or access of the file without any modifications to its content. This `README.md` provides extensive documentation for setting up and developing in the `tink-backend` repository, covering:
*   **Repository Overview:** Mentions that it contains source code for many backend services at Tink, with links to other related repositories.
*   **Table of READMEs:** A comprehensive list of internal documentation files such as `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README_BAZEL.md`, `README_BEGINNER.md`, `README_GIT.md`, `README_KAFKA.md`, `README_MIGRATIONS.md`, and `README_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.
*   **Getting Started:** A guide for new users, recommending the `README_BEGINNER.md`.
*   **Up and Running:** Detailed instructions for setting up the development environment, including:
    *   Using Bazel for building services and Minikube for infrastructure dependencies.
    *   Prerequisites installation using Homebrew for macOS (Intel and M1 specific instructions) and Linux (Java, Docker, Google Cloud CLI, Bazel).
    *   Installation of virtualization providers (Docker, HyperKit, VirtualBox for macOS; KVM2, VirtualBox for Linux).
    *   Steps for forking and cloning repositories, authenticating with ECR and jFrog, and setting up Minikube.
    *   Commands for building services and setting up GitHub Packages.
*   **Coding Guidelines:** Refers to `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
*   **Working with Bazel:** Explains Bazel's role in the project, including `BUILD` files, `WORKSPACE`, `.bazelrc`, and `.bazelproject`. Provides commands for building services, running unit tests (including debugging and log adjustment), and executing binaries.
*   **Programming with Go:** Guidelines for Go development, emphasizing the use of a single `go.mod` file, Bazel in CI, `BUILD` files (generated by Gazelle), and steps for new Go projects (listing in `gazelle-external`, Docker build rule, registering in `catalog-info.yaml`). Bazel with Gazelle supports Go modules for dependency management.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/tink-backend/src/main/api/src/main/java/se/tink/backend/api/WebHookService.java`**
This Java interface defines the `WebHookService` for API endpoints related to webhooks. All three methods within this service (`listHooks`, `createHook`, `deleteHook`) are marked as `@Deprecated`, explicitly stating that "Users should migrate to Events V1 (webhooks v2) instead." They are secured with OAuth2 using the `USER_WEB_HOOKS` scope and assigned `TeamOwnership` to `Team.TRANSACTIONS`.
*   **Timestamps:** On October 31, 2025, between 10:37:59 AM and 10:38:12 AM, the `createHook` and `deleteHook` methods were modified. The `hidden = true` attribute was added to their `@ApiOperation` annotations. This change ensures that these deprecated API endpoints are no longer visible in the generated API documentation (e.g., Swagger UI). The `listHooks` method already included `hidden = true`.
*   A subsequent log entry at 10:38:18 AM shows no further content changes, indicating another save or access operation without modification.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   The `README.md` file, despite multiple log entries, shows no content changes, suggesting these were likely save or refresh actions.
*   The `WebHookService.java` file's changes on October 31, 2025, consistently involved hiding deprecated webhook API endpoints from documentation, reinforcing the deprecation message.
*   Both files are part of the `tink-backend` project and illustrate different aspects: comprehensive project setup and API management.
*   The timestamps indicate activity on consecutive days, with setup/documentation on the 30th and API deprecation handling on the 31st.

## 11:25:19 AM
The changes primarily revolve around introducing and implementing a dual-path strategy for fetching and listing transactions, allowing the system to retrieve data from either Cassandra (V1 data) or Elasticsearch. This new functionality is controlled by a feature toggle.

**Key Information and File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go` (10/29/2025, 9:04:34 PM and 9:04:54 PM):**
    *   **Cassandra Integration:** Introduced new structures (`PaginationCursor`) and an interface (`cassandraRepository`) to facilitate cursor-based pagination and data retrieval from Cassandra.
    *   **Dual-Path Logic:** The `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl` now includes a `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag. The `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` methods were modified to conditionally delegate requests to either Cassandra-specific (`getTransactionFromCassandra`, `listTransactionsFromCassandra`) or Elasticsearch-specific (`getTransactionFromElasticsearch`, `listTransactionsFromElasticsearch`) implementations based on this flag.
    *   **Cursor-Based Pagination:** Detailed logic for `listTransactionsFromCassandra` was added, outlining how to parse cursors, calculate periods, fetch data from Cassandra using a cursor, apply filters, sort results, and generate the next page token.
    *   The second timestamp for this file (9:04:54 PM) indicates the completion of the `ListTransactions` method's conditional routing, solidifying the dual-path approach for both single transaction retrieval and listing multiple transactions.

*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server_test.go` (10/29/2025, 9:32:11 PM):**
    *   **Extensive Testing:** Introduced a `mockCassandraRepo` to simulate Cassandra operations for testing purposes.
    *   **New Test Cases:** Added comprehensive unit tests for both `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` methods when using the Cassandra path. These tests cover successful retrieval, validation errors (e.g., missing UserID/TransactionId), and "not found" scenarios.
    *   **Feature Toggle Activation:** Tests explicitly enable the `fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2` feature toggle to activate the new Cassandra-based logic.
    *   Continued testing of `convertRequest` function which handles conversion of internal v2 list requests to search requests, likely for the Elasticsearch path or shared filter logic.

*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/featuretoggle/feature_toggle.go` (10/29/2025, 9:43:03 PM):**
    *   **New Feature Toggle:** A new feature toggle, `FetchV1FromCassandraForV2Toggle`, was introduced. This toggle provides a mechanism to dynamically control whether the system reads V1 transaction data from Cassandra for V2 API requests.
    *   The `IsEnabled()` method for this toggle checks the "fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2" flag in Unleash.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Migration/Dual-Read Strategy:** A clear pattern is the implementation of a controlled migration or dual-read strategy, allowing the system to serve data from an older Cassandra v1 source through a newer internal v2 API, alongside the existing Elasticsearch path.
*   **Feature Toggle Control:** The use of a dedicated feature toggle (`fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2`) is a recurring theme, indicating a phased rollout or A/B testing approach for switching between data sources.
*   **Cursor-Based Pagination:** This is a significant functional enhancement, specifically for Cassandra, to efficiently handle large transaction lists.
*   **Timestamp Concentration:** All recorded changes occurred on the same date (10/29/2025) within a relatively short time frame, suggesting a focused effort on this specific feature implementation and its related testing and toggle management.

## 12:09:20 PM
The `BUILD` file at `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/api-docs/docs/BUILD`, last modified on `10/30/2025, 8:59:23 AM`, outlines the process for building and deploying aggregated API documentation for Tink's services.

Key updates and patterns in this file include:

*   **API Documentation Aggregation**: The core function is to collect and potentially merge numerous OpenAPI/Swagger specification files. A `container_layer` named `swagger` is explicitly defined to gather these specifications from a wide array of gRPC services and backend components. This list includes `authentication_configuration_service`, `income_checks/v2`, `risk_insights`, `expense_checks/v1`, `merchants/v1`, `settlement_accounts/v1`, `bulk_payments/v1`, various transaction history services, `golden_receiver`, `budgets-bfm`, `cash-flow`, `financial-calendar`, `link/session/v1`, and `account-proxy/v2`. The recurring `_swagger` and `_fixed_swagger` suffixes indicate a standardized way of referencing these API definitions.
*   **Go Application for Merging**: A `go_library` named `go_default_library` is built from `merge.go`, which depends on `go-openapi/loads` and `go-openapi/spec`. This suggests a Go application is responsible for processing or combining the collected Swagger definitions.
*   **Docker Image Creation and Deployment**: A `container_image` named `image` is constructed using a Debian base, incorporating an `entrypoint.sh` script and the compiled Go `merge` program, along with the aggregated `swagger` layer. This image is then pushed to an AWS ECR registry (`784217881480.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`) under the repository `api-docs`, tagged with `{GATEWAY_VERSION}`, indicating an automated deployment pipeline for the API documentation.
*   **Testing**: A `go_test` target is present for `merge_test.go`, confirming that the merging logic has associated unit tests.

In summary, this `BUILD` file defines the continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) process for creating a consolidated API documentation portal or service by aggregating Swagger/OpenAPI definitions from a microservices architecture, processing them with a Go application, and deploying the result as a Docker image to AWS ECR.

## 12:25:17 PM
The provided log primarily details changes across two distinct files within the `tink-backend` project: a `README.md` file and a `WebHookService.java` interface.

For the file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/tink-backend/README.md`, there are multiple entries on October 30, 2025, between 8:41:56 AM and 8:52:56 AM. Despite the frequent timestamps, the content of the `README.md` as provided in the log remains consistently identical across all these entries. This README outlines the repository's purpose, a table of other internal READMEs (e.g., CONTRIBUTING, BAZEL, BEGINNER, GIT, KAFKA, MIGRATIONS), getting started instructions (including prerequisites for macOS and Linux, Bazel and minikube setup, ECR authentication, and jFrog authentication), coding guidelines, and detailed information on working with Bazel for building, testing, and running binaries. It also includes guidelines for programming with Go, emphasizing Bazel, Gazelle, and `go.mod` for dependency management.

The more significant changes are observed in the file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/tink-backend/src/main/api/src/main/java/se/tink/backend/api/WebHookService.java`. On October 31, 2025, a series of updates occurred:
*   At 10:37:59 AM, the `WebHookService` interface defined three deprecated operations: `listHooks`, `createHook`, and `deleteHook`. All these operations were marked with `@Deprecated` and included a note advising users to migrate to "Events V1 (webhooks v2) instead." The `listHooks` operation was explicitly marked as `hidden = true` in its `@ApiOperation`, meaning it wouldn't appear in the API documentation, but `createHook` and `deleteHook` were not hidden.
*   A key update occurred at 10:38:12 AM, where the `createHook` and `deleteHook` methods were modified to also include `hidden = true` in their `@ApiOperation` annotations. This change made all deprecated webhook operations (`listHooks`, `createHook`, `deleteHook`) hidden from the generated API documentation.
*   A subsequent entry at 10:38:18 AM shows no further changes to the content of `WebHookService.java`, being identical to the 10:38:12 AM version.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
*   October 30, 2025, 8:41:56 AM: Initial log of the comprehensive `README.md`. No content changes were observed in subsequent entries for this file on the same day.
*   October 31, 2025, 10:37:59 AM: Initial log of the `WebHookService.java` with deprecated methods, some hidden.
*   October 31, 2025, 10:38:12 AM: Crucial update to `WebHookService.java` where previously visible deprecated API operations (`createHook`, `deleteHook`) were explicitly hidden from API documentation.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
A clear pattern emerges in `WebHookService.java` related to API deprecation and management. The initial deprecation of the webhook services (with a migration path to "Events V1") was followed by an explicit action to hide the remaining deprecated endpoints from API documentation. This indicates a proactive strategy to guide developers away from older, soon-to-be-removed or replaced functionalities by making them less discoverable. All changes are concentrated on a single backend project, `tink-backend`. The usage of Bazel as a build tool and minikube for infrastructure dependencies is a recurring theme in the `README.md`.

## 12:25:23 PM
The provided log details significant updates across three Go files related to a transaction service, primarily focusing on its internal gRPC server, associated tests, and feature toggles.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go (10/29/2025, 9:04:34 PM and 9:04:54 PM):**
    *   This file introduces substantial changes to the `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl`, enhancing transaction retrieval and listing capabilities.
    *   A new `PaginationCursor` struct and a `cassandraRepository` interface have been defined to support cursor-based pagination for Cassandra.
    *   The `ListTransactions` method has been refactored to implement this cursor-based pagination logic when querying Cassandra. Detailed comments outlining the optimized request flow are included.
    *   A key update is the explicit handling of data source selection for both `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` methods, which now decide whether to fetch data from Cassandra V1 (acting as V2) or Elasticsearch based on the `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag. The second timestamp specifically completes the conditional logic for the `ListTransactions` function to correctly delegate to either `listTransactionsFromCassandra` or `listTransactionsFromElasticsearch`.
    *   Observability is maintained with `ddtrace/tracer` spans for both Cassandra and Elasticsearch data paths.

*   **/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server_test.go (10/29/2025, 9:32:11 PM):**
    *   This test file was updated to include comprehensive unit tests for the newly enhanced `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` methods within the `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl`.
    *   A `mockCassandraRepo` implementation was added to simulate Cassandra interactions, allowing for isolated testing of the service logic.
    *   Tests cover various scenarios including successful retrieval, validation failures (e.g., empty user or transaction IDs), and handling of "not found" cases.
    *   The tests also demonstrate the use of a fake Unleash server to enable the `fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2` feature flag, ensuring the Cassandra V1 path for V2 API is tested.
    *   The `Test_convertRequest` function further validates the transformation of internal V2 list requests into V1 search requests, covering aspects like page size, page tokens, account filters, and transaction status mappings.

*   **/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/featuretoggle/feature_toggle.go (10/29/2025, 9:43:03 PM):**
    *   This file introduces a new feature toggle named `fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2`.
    *   This toggle, implemented as `fetchV1FromCassandraForV2Toggle`, provides a mechanism to control, at runtime, whether the transaction service should fetch V1 transactions from Cassandra for the V2 internal API.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Feature Flag Driven Development:** A prominent pattern is the use of feature flags (specifically `fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2`) to control the behavior of the internal gRPC server, allowing for a gradual rollout or A/B testing of data sources (Cassandra V1 vs. Elasticsearch) for the V2 API.
*   **Cursor-Based Pagination:** The introduction of `PaginationCursor` and the detailed `ListTransactions` flow highlight a shift towards efficient, cursor-based pagination, particularly for Cassandra, to handle large datasets more effectively.
*   **Dual Data Source Strategy:** The service is designed to support both Cassandra V1 and Elasticsearch as data sources for transactions, indicating a migration strategy or a need for flexibility in data retrieval.
*   **AI-Influenced Code:** The presence of `/* START GENAI */` and `/* END GENAI */` comments surrounding the `PaginationCursor`, `cassandraRepository` interface, and the detailed `ListTransactions` flow description suggests that these sections of code or their design were generated or heavily assisted by an AI tool.
*   **Robust Error Handling and Observability:** Consistent use of gRPC status codes for error reporting and Datadog tracing (`tracer.StartSpanFromContext`) indicates a focus on service reliability and monitoring.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** The test file demonstrates a commitment to thorough testing, especially for new features and different data paths, using mocks and a fake feature toggle server to ensure isolated and reliable tests.

## 1:09:21 PM
The `BUILD` file located at `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/api-docs/docs/BUILD`, last modified on `10/30/2025, 8:59:23 AM`, outlines the Bazel build configuration for an API documentation service.

The primary function of this file is to compile and package various OpenAPI/Swagger specifications into a deployable Docker image. Key updates and components include:

*   **Go Library**: A `go_library` named `go_default_library` is defined, originating from `merge.go`. This library is responsible for processing or merging OpenAPI specifications, indicated by its dependencies on `@com_github_go_openapi_loads` and `@com_github_go_openapi_spec`.
*   **Swagger Aggregation Layer**: A `container_layer` named `swagger` is a central element. It explicitly lists numerous `_swagger` or `_fixed_swagger` files sourced from various Tink gRPC services and backend modules. This includes specifications for `authentication_configuration_service`, `income_checks/v2`, `risk_insights`, `expense_checks/v1`, `merchants/v1`, `settlement_accounts/v1`, `bulk_payments/v1`, `transaction_history/transactions/v2`, `golden_receiver`, `budgets-bfm`, `cash-flow`, `financial-calendar`, `link/session/v1`, and `account/account-proxy/v2`. This pattern of collecting multiple service-specific Swagger files strongly suggests an initiative to centralize and provide a unified API documentation experience.
*   **Docker Image Creation**: A `container_image` named `image` is constructed using a Debian base. It includes an `entrypoint.sh` script and the compiled `merge` command, leveraging the aggregated `swagger` layer. This image is clearly designed to host and potentially serve the merged API documentation.
*   **Deployment to ECR**: A `container_push` rule named `docker_push` is configured to publish the `image` to an AWS ECR registry (`784217881480.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`) under the repository `api-docs`. The image is tagged dynamically with `{GATEWAY_VERSION}`, indicating its role in supporting API gateway deployments.
*   **Testing**: A `go_test` target is defined for `merge_test.go`, including test data, ensuring the functionality of the `merge` utility.

The recurring pattern across the content is the consistent reference to `_swagger` or `_fixed_swagger` files from a wide array of internal services, highlighting a systematic approach to collecting and presenting API definitions from different parts of the Tink ecosystem. This build configuration facilitates the automated creation and deployment of comprehensive API documentation.

## 1:25:09 PM
The changes log shows updates across two distinct files.

For the file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/tink-backend/README.md`, multiple entries were logged on 10/30/2025 between 8:41:56 AM and 8:52:56 AM. However, the content for this file remained identical across all recorded timestamps, indicating no substantive text changes within the README itself during this period, potentially reflecting metadata updates or repeated saves without content modification. The README provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and working with the `tink-backend` repository, covering topics like project structure, Bazel usage, local development with minikube, and Go programming guidelines.

The file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/tink-backend/src/main/api/src/main/java/se/tink/backend/api/WebHookService.java` saw specific content updates on 10/31/2025, around 10:38 AM. This Java interface defines API endpoints for managing webhooks. The key change across these timestamps was the addition of `hidden = true` to the `ApiOperation` annotations for the `listHooks`, `createHook`, and `deleteHook` methods. These methods were already marked with `@Deprecated` and included a note advising users to "migrate to Events V1 (webhooks v2) instead."

A clear pattern emerges in the `WebHookService.java` file, where existing deprecated webhook endpoints are systematically being hidden from the API documentation. This indicates a phased deprecation strategy, making older functionalities less visible while guiding users towards newer "Events V1 (webhooks v2)" alternatives.

## 1:25:27 PM
The core of these changes revolves around enhancing the transaction service's ability to fetch data from different sources (Cassandra and Elasticsearch) and implementing advanced pagination, particularly for Cassandra. A new feature toggle is introduced to control this behavior.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go` (10/29/2025, 9:04:34 PM and 9:04:54 PM):**
    *   Introduced significant new logic for fetching transactions, specifically from Cassandra (V1 data converted to V2 internal format), alongside existing Elasticsearch fetching.
    *   Defined a `PaginationCursor` struct and a `cassandraRepository` interface to support cursor-based pagination for Cassandra.
    *   Modified the `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl` to include a `cassandraRepo` dependency and a `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag to switch between Cassandra and Elasticsearch data sources at runtime.
    *   Implemented `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` methods with conditional logic based on the `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag, delegating to `...FromCassandra` or `...FromElasticsearch` helper methods.
    *   The `listTransactionsFromCassandra` method implements complex cursor-based pagination, including parsing cursors, calculating periods, fetching data from Cassandra with `FindByUserIDAndPeriodWithCursor`, filtering, sorting, and encoding the next page token.
    *   Extensive comments marked `/* START GENAI */` and `/* END GENAI */` appear throughout the newly added structures and methods, suggesting these sections were either generated or heavily influenced by AI tools, particularly for the pagination logic.
    *   Tracing (`tracer.StartSpanFromContext`) is consistently applied to new data retrieval paths.

*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server_test.go` (10/29/2025, 9:32:11 PM):**
    *   Introduced a `mockCassandraRepo` to facilitate unit testing of the new Cassandra-based transaction retrieval methods.
    *   Added `Test_GetTransaction` and `Test_ListTransactions` functions to thoroughly test the new Cassandra functionality, including successful retrieval, handling of missing user/transaction IDs, and "not found" scenarios.
    *   These tests leverage a fake feature toggle to enable the "fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2" behavior, ensuring the correct data source is being exercised.
    *   Similar `/* START GENAI */` and `/* END GENAI */` comments are present, aligning with the pattern observed in `internal_server.go`.

*   **`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/featuretoggle/feature_toggle.go` (10/29/2025, 9:43:03 PM):**
    *   A new feature toggle, `FetchV1FromCassandraForV2Toggle`, was added. This toggle checks an Unleash feature flag named `"fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2"`.
    *   This feature toggle is critical for controlling the `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag's behavior in `internal_server.go`, allowing dynamic switching between Cassandra and Elasticsearch data sources for transaction retrieval.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Dual Data Source Strategy:** A prominent pattern is the implementation of a dual-path strategy for transaction retrieval, allowing the service to fetch data from either Cassandra (V1 data converted to V2 internal format) or Elasticsearch. This is managed by a boolean flag and a feature toggle.
*   **Cursor-Based Pagination:** The Cassandra implementation specifically focuses on cursor-based pagination, a more robust method for handling large datasets and sequential access.
*   **Feature Toggling:** The introduction of the `"fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2"` feature flag is a recurring theme, enabling controlled rollout and runtime switching of the new Cassandra data source.
*   **AI-Assisted Development:** The repeated `/* START GENAI */` and `/* END GENAI */` comments suggest that significant portions of the new code, particularly the complex pagination logic and associated tests, were either generated or extensively guided by AI tools.
*   **Tracing:** DataDog tracing (`tracer.StartSpanFromContext`) is consistently used across the new data retrieval methods, indicating a focus on observability and performance monitoring.
*   **Unified Timestamp:** All changes occurred on the same date within a relatively short timeframe, indicating a focused development effort on this specific feature.

## 2:09:21 PM
The provided log details a significant update to the Bazel build configuration for `tink-ab/tink-api-gateway` API documentation, timestamped at **10/30/2025, 8:59:23 AM**.

**File: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/api-docs/docs/BUILD`**
This Bazel `BUILD` file is responsible for compiling, packaging, and deploying the API documentation for the Tink gateway. Key updates include:

*   **Go Library and Merging:** A `go_library` named `go_default_library` is defined, which compiles `merge.go`. This Go application is likely responsible for consolidating or processing multiple API Swagger/OpenAPI specifications.
*   **Swagger Aggregation (container_layer):** A `container_layer` named `swagger` has been updated to include an extensive list of Swagger definitions from various Tink gRPC services. This indicates a central effort to gather and make available documentation for a wide range of functionalities. These include:
    *   **Financial Data:** `authentication_configuration_service`, `income_checks/v2`, `risk_insights`, `expense_checks/v1`, `merchants/v1`, `settlement_accounts/v1`, `settlement_account_payment_requests/v1`, `bulk_payments/v1`, `transaction_history/transactions/v2`, `golden_receiver`, `budgets-bfm`, `cash-flow`, `financial-calendar`.
    *   **Reporting:** `transaction_history/reports/v2`.
    *   **Core Infrastructure:** `link/proto/session/v1`, `account/account-proxy/proxy/proto/v2`.
    This list shows the integration of documentation from both `com_tink_api_grpc` and `se_tink_backend` sources.
*   **Docker Image Creation:** A `container_image` named `image` is built on a `debian-debootstrap` base, including an `entrypoint.sh` script, the compiled `docs/cmd/merge` binary, and the aggregated `:swagger` layer. This suggests the documentation is served or processed within a containerized environment.
*   **ECR Deployment:** A `container_push` rule (`docker_push`) is configured to push the `:image` to an AWS ECR registry (`784217881480.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/api-docs`), tagged with the `{GATEWAY_VERSION}`. This automates the deployment of the consolidated API documentation.
*   **Testing:** A `go_test` entry confirms the presence of `merge_test.go` for the Go library, ensuring the documentation merging logic is tested.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Centralized API Documentation:** The changes highlight a strong pattern of centralizing API documentation, particularly Swagger/OpenAPI specifications, from numerous microservices into a single build and deployment process.
*   **Bazel as Build System:** Bazel is consistently used for defining build, test, and deployment targets across Go and Docker.
*   **Microservices Architecture:** The extensive list of `swagger` files from various services (e.g., income checks, risk insights, payments, transactions, budgets) points to a comprehensive microservices architecture at Tink.
*   **Containerization and Cloud Deployment:** Docker containers and AWS ECR are standard components for packaging and deploying this documentation, indicating a cloud-native approach.
*   **Swagger/OpenAPI Focus:** The repeated use of `_swagger` in file names signifies that OpenAPI/Swagger is the chosen standard for defining API interfaces.

## 2:25:19 PM
The provided log primarily details activity on two files: `README.md` and `WebHookService.java`.

For the file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/tink-backend/README.md`:
Across multiple timestamps on **October 30, 2025**, from 8:41:56 AM to 8:52:56 AM, the content of this file remained entirely consistent. The README provides a comprehensive overview of the `tink-backend` repository. It outlines how to get started, including common prerequisites for macOS (with specific notes for M1 chips) and Linux using Homebrew, minikube for infrastructure dependencies, and Bazel for building services. It details authentication steps for ECR and jFrog, minikube setup, building, testing, and running binaries with Bazel. Furthermore, it includes dedicated sections for coding guidelines, working with Bazel, and programming with Go, emphasizing the use of Bazel with Gazelle for dependency management. The README also links to various internal documentation (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README_BAZEL.md`, `README_BEGINNER.md`, etc.).

For the file `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/tink-backend/src/main/api/src/main/java/se/tink/backend/api/WebHookService.java`:
This Java interface, `WebHookService`, defines endpoints for managing OAuth2 webhooks. A significant change occurred at **October 31, 2025, 10:38:12 AM**. At this timestamp, the `createHook` and `deleteHook` API operations were updated to explicitly include `hidden = true` in their `@ApiOperation` annotations. Prior to this, only the `listHooks` operation was explicitly marked as hidden. All three methods (`listHooks`, `createHook`, `deleteHook`) in this service are consistently marked with `@Deprecated`, accompanied by a clear message instructing users to "migrate to Events V1 (webhooks v2) instead."

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The most prominent pattern is the **deprecation of the existing webhook API** in `WebHookService.java`, strongly indicating a shift towards a new "Events V1 (webhooks v2)" system. This is reinforced by marking the deprecated operations as `hidden = true`, suggesting they should no longer be actively exposed or used.
The project heavily leverages **Bazel** as its primary build, test, and run tool, with extensive setup and command examples provided in the `README.md`.
**Minikube** is consistently presented as the local development environment for infrastructure dependencies.
The project supports both **Java and Go** development, with specific guidelines for each, especially concerning Bazel integration and dependency management.

## 2:25:26 PM
The core theme of these changes revolves around integrating Cassandra as an alternative data source for the internal transaction service, specifically for V2 API requests, with a strong emphasis on controlled rollout via feature toggles and optimized pagination.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server.go (10/29/2025, 9:04:34 PM & 9:04:54 PM):**
    *   **Cassandra Integration:** The service now supports fetching transactions from Cassandra v1, alongside the existing Elasticsearch. This is governed by a `readCassandraV1AsV2` boolean field in `InternalTransactionsServiceServerImpl`.
    *   **New Pagination Mechanism:** Introduced `PaginationCursor` for cursor-based pagination tailored for Cassandra. This involves storing the `LastPeriod` (YYYYMM) and `LastTransactionID` (UUID) in the cursor.
    *   **Cassandra Repository:** Defined a `cassandraRepository` interface with methods `GetTransactionsByUserIDAndIDsWithPeriods` and `FindByUserIDAndPeriodWithCursor` to abstract Cassandra operations.
    *   **Conditional Logic:** The `GetTransaction` and `ListTransactions` gRPC methods now include conditional logic to dispatch requests to either Cassandra-specific (`getTransactionFromCassandra`, `listTransactionsFromCassandra`) or Elasticsearch-specific (`getTransactionFromElasticsearch`, `listTransactionsFromElasticsearch`) implementations based on the `readCassandraV1AsV2` flag.
    *   **`listTransactionsFromCassandra`:** This new method implements cursor-based pagination, including decoding/encoding cursors, calculating periods from date ranges, fetching transactions from Cassandra with `LIMIT` and `AFTER` clauses, applying filters, and sorting.
    *   **Data Conversion:** Transactions fetched from Cassandra v1 are converted to the v2 internal format using `cassandra.FromCassandraV1ToV2Internal`.
    *   The second timestamp (9:04:54 PM) primarily completes the `ListTransactions` method's conditional dispatcher.

*   **/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/grpc/internal_server_test.go (10/29/2025, 9:32:11 PM):**
    *   **Mocking Cassandra:** Introduced `mockCassandraRepo` to enable isolated testing of Cassandra-related logic. This mock implements the `cassandraRepository` interface.
    *   **New Test Cases:** Added comprehensive test cases for `Test_GetTransaction` and `Test_ListTransactions` specifically targeting the Cassandra path. These tests cover successful retrieval, missing user/transaction IDs, and "not found" scenarios.
    *   **Feature Toggle Control:** Tests utilize `featuretoggle.InitFake()` and `fakeUnleash.Enable("fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2")` to simulate the feature flag being enabled, ensuring the Cassandra path is exercised.

*   **/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/transaction-service/internal/featuretoggle/feature_toggle.go (10/29/2025, 9:43:03 PM):**
    *   **New Feature Toggle:** A new feature toggle, `FetchV1FromCassandraForV2Toggle`, has been added. This toggle (`"fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2"`) provides granular control over whether the service fetches V1 transactions from Cassandra for V2 internal API requests.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

All changes occurred on **October 29, 2025**.
*   **9:04:34 PM** and **9:04:54 PM**: Core logic for Cassandra integration and cursor-based pagination introduced/completed in `internal_server.go`.
*   **9:32:11 PM**: Corresponding unit tests for the new Cassandra integration were added in `internal_server_test.go`.
*   **9:43:03 PM**: The feature toggle mechanism to control this new functionality was formally added in `feature_toggle.go`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Feature Flag-Driven Development:** A consistent pattern is the use of a feature flag (`fetch-v1-from-cassandra-for-v2`) to enable or disable the Cassandra data source. This allows for staged rollouts, A/B testing, or easy toggling in production environments.
*   **Dual Data Source Strategy:** The service now supports two distinct data sources (Cassandra and Elasticsearch) for transaction retrieval, with a clear separation of logic for each.
*   **API Versioning/Migration:** The changes indicate a process of migrating or extending the V2 internal API to leverage existing Cassandra V1 data, requiring conversion logic.
*   **Performance Optimization:** The detailed documentation of the `ListTransactions` flow for Cassandra highlights an optimized cursor-based pagination approach, suggesting a focus on efficient data handling, especially for large datasets.
*   **Test-Driven or Post-Feature Testing:** The rapid follow-up of test cases after the core logic implementation indicates a robust testing practice.
