# Activity Summary for 10/31/2025

## 8:09:18 AM

The provided log details changes to a single Bazel `BUILD` file, specifically located at `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/api-docs/docs/BUILD`. This file, last updated on 10/30/2025 at 8:59:23 AM, is responsible for building, testing, and deploying API documentation for the Tink project.

Key information from this change includes:

*   **Bazel Build Configuration:** The file heavily leverages Bazel rules for Go (`go_library`, `go_test`) and Docker (`container_layer`, `container_image`, `container_push`). It defines a Go library from `merge.go` and a corresponding test file, likely for processing or merging API specifications.
*   **API Documentation Aggregation:** A central feature is the `container_layer` named `swagger`. This layer explicitly bundles a large number of Swagger/OpenAPI definition files (`.swagger` or `_fixed_swagger`) from various gRPC services and backend components. This indicates a robust system for collecting and consolidating API documentation from disparate services within the Tink ecosystem. Recurring patterns like `@com_tink_api_grpc//...` and `@se_tink_backend//...` point to automated generation and inclusion of these specifications.
*   **Docker Image Creation:** An `api-docs` Docker image is configured (`container_image` name `image`). This image is based on `debian-debootstrap`, uses an `entrypoint.sh` script, includes a compiled `merge` command, and crucially, incorporates the `swagger` layer containing all the aggregated API definitions. This suggests the merged documentation is intended to be served via this Docker container.
*   **Deployment to AWS ECR:** The `container_push` rule specifies deployment of the `api-docs` image to an AWS ECR registry (`784217881480.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/api-docs`), tagged with `{GATEWAY_VERSION}`. This indicates an automated pipeline for publishing the compiled API documentation.

In summary, this change represents an update to the CI/CD pipeline for Tink's API documentation, focusing on automatically gathering numerous Swagger definitions from various services, merging them, packaging them into a Docker image, and pushing this image to AWS ECR for deployment, presumably to serve as a central API reference.

## 8:25:09 AM
The provided log primarily tracks a single file: `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/tink-backend/README.md`.

**File-Specific Updates:**
Despite being logged multiple times between 8:41:56 AM and 8:52:56 AM on October 30, 2025, the content of the `README.md` file remained entirely unchanged across all entries. Each log entry presents the exact same comprehensive documentation.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
There are no significant changes in the content to highlight at specific timestamps, as the file's content is identical across all logged versions.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in Content:**
The content consistently details the structure and development guidelines for the `tink-backend` repository. Key recurring themes and elements within this `README.md` include:
*   **Overview:** Describes the repository as containing source code for many backend services at Tink, with links to related repositories.
*   **Table of READMEs:** A prominent section listing various specific README files covering aspects like contributing, Bazel, beginner guidance, code ownership, transaction rules, Git, Kafka, keystore management, database migrations, translations, and troubleshooting.
*   **Getting Started:** A detailed guide for new developers, emphasizing reading the `README_BEGINNER.md`.
*   **Setup and Running:** Extensive instructions for getting services up and running, which consistently involve:
    *   **Bazel:** All services are built with Bazel, with instructions for installation on macOS (including M1 specifics) and Linux.
    *   **Minikube:** Services run infrastructure dependencies inside Minikube, with setup steps and driver installation guides for macOS (Docker, HyperKit, VirtualBox) and Linux (KVM2, VirtualBox).
    *   **Prerequisites:** Common dependencies like Git, minikube, kubernetes-cli, gettext, Go, Java (OpenJDK 8 & 11), Docker, Google Cloud SDK are consistently mentioned.
    *   **Authentication:** Steps for authenticating to ECR and Tink's jFrog.
    *   **Development Workflow:** Commands for starting minikube services, running `kubectl` to check pods, building services with Bazel, and setting up GitHub Packages.
*   **Development Guidelines:** Sections on "Coding guidelines" (referencing `CONTRIBUTING.md`) and "Working with Bazel" (referencing `README_BAZEL.md`).
*   **Bazel Usage:** Detailed instructions for building services, running unit tests (including filtering and debug modes), and executing binaries, with specific Bazel commands.
*   **Go Programming:** Guidelines for Go development, including using standard Go workflow or Bazel, a single `go.mod` file, `BUILD` files generated by Gazelle, and requirements for new Go projects (listing in `gazelle-external`, Docker build rule, `catalog-info.yaml` registration).
*   **Dependency Management:** Highlighted use of Bazel with Gazelle for Go modules.

In summary, the log entries indicate monitoring or repetitive saving of the `README.md` file, which serves as a central hub for development information, setup instructions, and best practices within the `tink-backend` project.
