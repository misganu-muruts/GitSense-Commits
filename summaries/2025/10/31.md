# Activity Summary for 10/31/2025

## 8:09:18 AM

The provided log details changes to a single Bazel `BUILD` file, specifically located at `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/api-docs/docs/BUILD`. This file, last updated on 10/30/2025 at 8:59:23 AM, is responsible for building, testing, and deploying API documentation for the Tink project.

Key information from this change includes:

*   **Bazel Build Configuration:** The file heavily leverages Bazel rules for Go (`go_library`, `go_test`) and Docker (`container_layer`, `container_image`, `container_push`). It defines a Go library from `merge.go` and a corresponding test file, likely for processing or merging API specifications.
*   **API Documentation Aggregation:** A central feature is the `container_layer` named `swagger`. This layer explicitly bundles a large number of Swagger/OpenAPI definition files (`.swagger` or `_fixed_swagger`) from various gRPC services and backend components. This indicates a robust system for collecting and consolidating API documentation from disparate services within the Tink ecosystem. Recurring patterns like `@com_tink_api_grpc//...` and `@se_tink_backend//...` point to automated generation and inclusion of these specifications.
*   **Docker Image Creation:** An `api-docs` Docker image is configured (`container_image` name `image`). This image is based on `debian-debootstrap`, uses an `entrypoint.sh` script, includes a compiled `merge` command, and crucially, incorporates the `swagger` layer containing all the aggregated API definitions. This suggests the merged documentation is intended to be served via this Docker container.
*   **Deployment to AWS ECR:** The `container_push` rule specifies deployment of the `api-docs` image to an AWS ECR registry (`784217881480.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/api-docs`), tagged with `{GATEWAY_VERSION}`. This indicates an automated pipeline for publishing the compiled API documentation.

In summary, this change represents an update to the CI/CD pipeline for Tink's API documentation, focusing on automatically gathering numerous Swagger definitions from various services, merging them, packaging them into a Docker image, and pushing this image to AWS ECR for deployment, presumably to serve as a central API reference.
