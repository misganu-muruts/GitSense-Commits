# Activity Summary for 9/25/2025

## 12:25:07 PM
The log shows several code changes across different files within the `tink/golden-receiver` project on September 25th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve database schema updates, mock data for testing, and the implementation of business logic for account and transaction management.


`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/golden-receiver/development/mysql/init.sql`: This file underwent two updates (11:57:02 AM and 11:59:28 AM) concerning the `users` and `users_apps_metadata` tables.  The SQL code creates these tables, defining various user attributes (including profile information, flags, and notification settings) and their association with applications.  The key change between the two commits is the update of the `app_id` in the `users_apps_metadata` table's INSERT statement, changing from '3f62e0c6341c4fdc8994f0b751fa78c7' to '25e8972dec1e4f84a015d703f0f77717'.


`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/golden-receiver/development/gripmock/userservice/stub/users.json`: This file, containing mock user service data, was updated twice (12:00:12 PM and 12:00:20 PM), with minimal changes between updates. The key difference is inconsequential; both entries remain the same except for an extremely small timestamp difference. Both updates show a mock response for a `GetUserProfile` call with `user_id` '2a9c5a1f664d4ec7a22c14c1d947900c', showcasing user profile data including flags, app ID, and external user ID. The `app_id` in this file is consistent with the final `app_id` in the updated `/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/golden-receiver/development/mysql/init.sql` file.


`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/golden-receiver/development/gripmock/accountservice/stub/get-account.json`:  This file contains mock account service data. It was updated three times between 12:01:38 PM and 12:02:18 PM. The first two updates are identical, showing a mock response for `GetAccount` with `account_id` 'e0179c7c1d534fb4af1f5c6c999a3df1' and associated user details (`user_id` '2a9c5a1f664d4ec7a22c14c1d947900c'). The third update introduces a new mock response for `account_id` 'd961151d665445999f3387263a9a6ee7', also linked to the same user ID.


`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/golden-receiver/README.md`: The README file was updated twice (12:05:27 PM and 12:08:51 PM).  The changes are minor, mainly involving a reordering of steps in the "Generate fake auth token" section.  The README provides instructions for local development, including building, running, and testing the service using `grpcurl` and specifies dependencies.  The README also shows details on managing protobuf files.


`/Users/mmuruts/projects/tink/golden-receiver/service/logic.go`: This file contains the implementation of the service's business logic at 12:24:23 PM. It shows functions for `DeleteAccounts` and `DeleteTransactions`, demonstrating interactions with other services (account service, user service), request validation, and error handling.  The code highlights a pattern of fetching user and account information based on external IDs and interacting with external services, utilizing  `grpc` calls to other services and also error handling and logging.
